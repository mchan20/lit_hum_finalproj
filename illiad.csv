1,42,let your arrows make the danans pay for my tears shed so he spoke in prayer and phoibos apollo heard him and strode down along the pinnacles of olympos angered 
1,360,now the son of atreus powerful agamemnon has dishonored me since he has taken away my prize and keeps it so he spoke in tears and the lady his mother heard him 
1,363,as she sat in the depths of the sea at the side of her aged father and lightly she emerged like a mist from the gray water she came and sat beside him as he wept and stroked him 
1,417,that atreus son wideruling agamemnon may recognize his madness that he did no honor to the best of the achaians thetis answered him then letting the tears fall ah me 
1,450,to lead back your daughter and accomplish a sacred hecatomb to apollo on behalf of the danans that we may propitiate the lord who has heaped unhappiness and tears on the argives 
2,39,for he thought that on that very day he would take priams city fool who knew nothing of all the things zeus planned to accomplish zeus who yet was minded to visit tears and sufferings 
2,270,so he spoke and dashed the scepter against his back and shoulders and he doubled over and a round tear dropped from him and a bloody welt stood up between his shoulders under 
2,702,children of euenos king and son of selepios for her sake he lay grieving now but was soon to rise up they who held phylak and pyrasos of the flowers 
3,144,after her husband of time before and her city and parents and at once wrapping herself about in shimmering garments she went forth from the chamber letting fall a light tear 
4,159,menelaos while their companions were mourning beside them dear brother it was your death i sealed in the oaths of friendship setting you alone before the achaians to fight with the trojans 
5,429,lest for a long time aigialeia wise child of adrastos mourning wake out of sleep her households beloved companions longing for the best of the achaians her lord by marriage 
5,783,for no reason and out of due order to grieve me and meanwhile kypris and apollo of the silver bow take their ease and their pleasure having let loose this maniac who knows nothing of justice 
5,897,and sat down beside kronian zeus grieving in his spirit and showed him the immortal blood dripping from the spear cut so in sorrow for himself he addressed him in winged words 
6,417,hektor smiled in silence as he looked on his son but she andromach stood close beside him letting her tears fall and clung to his hand and called him by name and spoke to him 
6,471,achaian leads you off taking away your day of liberty in tears and in argos you must work at the loom of another and carry water from the spring messeis or hypereia 
6,474,all unwilling but strong will be the necessity upon you and some day seeing you shedding tears a man will say of you this is the wife of hektor who was ever the bravest fighter 
6,501,wife who took him back again to her fragrant bosom smiling in her tears and her husband saw and took pity upon her and stroked her with his hand and called her by name and spoke to 
6,513,so glorious hektor spoke and again took up the helmet with its crest of horsehair while his beloved wife went homeward turning to look back on the way letting the live tears fall 
7,438,it hard to recognize each individual dead man but with water they washed away the blood that was on them and as they wept warm tears they lifted them onto the wagons 
8,129,and bitter sorrow closed over hektors heart for his driver yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there and went on after another bold charioteer and it was not 
8,255,the achaians be thus beaten down at the hands of the trojans he spoke thus and as he wept the father took pity upon him and bent his head that the people should stay alive and not perish 
8,330,yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there and called to his brother kebriones who stood near to take up the reins of the horses nor did he disobey him but hektor 
8,453,the goddesses themselves took their place on the golden couches among the other immortals their hearts deep grieving within them now father zeus steered back from ida his strongwheeled chariot 
9,15,they took their seats in assembly dispirited and agamemnon stood up before them shedding tears like a spring darkrunning that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water 
9,444,but at long last phoinix the aged horseman spoke out in a stormburst of tears and fearing for the ships of the achaians if it is going home glorious achilleus you ponder 
9,582,alkyone seabird as a byname since for her sake her mother with the sorrowladen cry of a seabird wept because farreaching phoibos apollo had taken her 
9,588,and many times beating with her hands on the earth abundant she called on hades and on honored persephon lying at length along the ground and the tears were wet on her bosom 
9,609,were mounting along the towers and set fire to the great city and then at last his wife the fairgirdled bride supplicated meleagros in tears and rehearsed in their numbers before him 
10,390,in green fear and these two breathing hard came up to him and caught him by the hands and he broke into tears and spoke to them 
11,579,a tawny lion away from the midfenced ground of their oxen and will not let him tear out the fat of the oxen watching nightlong against him and he in his hunger for meat closes in 
11,804,he will weep much too late when his people are perished from him dear child surely this was what menoitios told you that day when he sent you out from phthia to agamemnon 
13,93,as they saw them the tears dripped from their eyes they did not think they could win clear of the evil but the earthshaker lightly turning their battalions to strength drove them onward 
13,198,then hektor charged in to tear the helm of greathearted amphimachos from his head where it fitted close on the brows but aias thrust with the shining spear at hektor as he came onward 
13,525,aineias and idomeneus both men like the war god were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other aineias was first with a spear cast at idomeneus 
13,579,from his shoulders but watchful as the trojans gathered about him from all sides and beat at the shining broad shield but could not get within it and tear with the pitiless bronze antilochos 
13,690,and the greathearted paphlagonians busied about him lifted him into a chariot and brought him to sacred ilion in sorrow and his father weeping tears walked beside them 
14,519,and mother from me that they can weep for him in their halls since neither shall the wife of promachos alegenors son take pride of delight in her dear lords coming on that day 
15,366,in the space before our city the dogs shall tear him to pieces so speaking with a whipstroke from the shoulder he lashed on his horses 
16,6,and stood by him and wept warm tears like a spring darkrunning that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water and swiftfooted brilliant achilleus looked on him in pity 
16,15,you are like such a one patroklos dropping these soft tears could you have some news to tell for me or the myrmidons have you and nobody else received some message from phthia 
16,21,the argives you are mourning over and how they are dying against the hollow ships by reason of their own arrogance tell me do not hide it in your mind and so we shall both know 
16,162,all in their war gear along the shelters and they as wolves who tear flesh raw in whose hearts the battle fury is tireless who have brought down a great horned stag in the mountains and then 
16,483,she spoke nor did the father of gods and men disobey her yet he wept tears of blood that fell to the ground for the sake of his beloved son whom now patroklos was presently 
16,681,for the strong henchman of achilleus the son of peleus once again to push the trojans and bronzehelmed hektor back on their city and tear the life from many in hektor 
16,789,so above kebriones these two urgent for battle patroklos son of menoitios and glorious hektor were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other 
16,891,mourning her destiny leaving youth and manhood behind her now though he was a dead man glorious hektor spoke to him patroklos what is this prophecy of my headlong destruction 
17,39,and left to his parents the curse of lamentation and sorrow yet i might stop the mourning of these unhappy people if i could carry back to them your head and your armor 
17,168,of lord priam if we could tear him out of the fighting the argives must at once give up the beautiful armor of sarpedon and we could carry his body inside ilion 
17,444,but the horses of aiakides standing apart from the battle wept as they had done since they heard how their charioteer had fallen in the dust at the hands of murderous hektor 
17,456,leaning their heads along the ground and warm tears were running earthward from underneath the lids of the mourning horses who longed for their charioteer while their bright manes were made 
17,462,as he watched the mourning horses the son of kronos pitied them and stirred his head and spoke to his own spirit poor wretches why then did we ever give you to the lord peleus 
17,480,automedon fought from them though grieving for his companion he would dash in like a vulture among geese with his horses and lightly get away out of the trojans confusion 
17,672,make bright the air and give sight back to our eyes in shining daylight destroy us if to destroy us be now your pleasure he spoke thus and as he wept the father took pity upon him 
17,684,and went on his way as from a midfenced ground some lion who has been harrying dogs and men but his strength is worn out they will not let him tear out the fat of the oxen watching 
17,705,plunges suddenly to grab him and tear the life from him so now in you menelaos illustrious the eyes shining circled everywhere your swarming hordes of companions 
17,723,filled with tears the springing voice was held still within him yet even so he neglected not menelaos order but went on the run handing his war gear to a blameless companion 
17,753,and made a rush against them like dogs who sweep in rapidly on a wounded wild boar ahead of the young men who hunt him and for the moment race in raging to tear him to pieces 
18,18,meanwhile the son of stately nestor was drawing near him and wept warm tears and gave achilleus his sorrowful message ah me son of valiant peleus you must hear from me 
18,33,beat their breastswith their hands and the limbs went slack in each of them on the other side antilochos mourned with him letting the tears fall 
18,69,so she spoke and left the cave and the others together went with her in tears and about them the wave of the water was broken now these when they came to the generous troad 
18,99,then in turn thetis spoke to him letting the tears fall then i must lose you soon my child by what you are saying since it is decreed your death must come soon after hektors 
18,129,to wipe away the close bursts of tears in her lamentation and learn that i stayed too long out of the fighting do not hold me back from the fight though you love me you will not 
18,243,and set him upon a litter and his own companions about him stood mourning and along with them swiftfooted achilleus went letting fall warm tears as he saw his steadfast companion 
18,354,until then you shall lie where you are in front of my curved ships and beside you women of troy and deepgirdled dardanian women shall sorrow for you night and day and shed tears for you those whom 
18,447,if i can and if it is a thing that can be accomplished then in turn thetis answered him letting the tears fall hephaistos is there among all the goddesses on olympos 
19,6,mourned she shining among divinities stood there beside them she clung to her sons hand and called him by name and spoke to him my child now though we grieve for him we must let this man lie 
19,135,and presently she came to mens establishments but zeus would forever grieve over her each time that he saw his dear son doing some shameful work of the tasks that eurystheus set him 
19,234,no but we must harden our hearts and bury the man who dies when we have wept over him on the day and all those who are left about from the hateful work of war must remember 
19,291,him in her arms cried shrilly above him and with her hands tore at her breasts and her soft throat and her beautiful forehead the woman like the immortals mourning for him spoke to him 
19,306,to phthia and formalize my marriage among the myrmidons therefore i weep your death without ceasing you were kind always so she spoke lamenting and the women sorrowed around her 
19,309,grieving openly for patroklos but for her own sorrows each but the lords of achaia were gathered about achilleus beseeching him to eat but he with a groan denied them 
19,330,who now i think in phthia somewhere lets fall a soft tear for bereavement of such a son for me who now in a strange land make war upon the trojans for the sake of accursed helen 
19,345,so he spoke mourning and the elders lamented around him remembering each those he had left behind in his own halls the son of kronos took pity on them as he watched them mourning 
19,351,now he has sat down before the steep horned ships and is mourning for his own beloved companion while all the others have gone to take their dinner but he is fasting and unfed 
21,72,straining to stab but he underran the stroke and caught him by the knees bending and the spear went over his back and stood fast in the ground for all its desire to tear a mans flesh lykaon 
21,510,then with her own bow smiling boxed her ears as artemis tried to twist away and the flying arrows were scattered she got under and free and fled in tears as a pigeon 
22,84,and side by side with him his mother in tears was mourning and laid the fold of her bosom bare and with one hand held out a breast and wept her tears for him and called to him in winged words 
22,93,nor can your generous wife mourn you but a big way from us beside the ships of the argives the running dogs will feed on you so these two in tears and with much supplication called out 
22,177,ah me this is a man beloved whom now my eyes watch being chased around the wall my heart is mourning for hektor who has burned in my honor many thigh pieces of oxen 
22,378,he spoke and as he spoke the end of death closed in upon him and the soul fluttering free of the limbs went down into deaths house mourning her destiny leaving youth and manhood behind her 
22,450,we two i myself and his mother who bore him unhappy might so have glutted ourselves with weeping for him and mourning so he spoke in tears and beside him mourned the citizens 
22,459,as if you were a god since in truth you were their high honor while you lived now death and fate have closed in upon you so she spoke in tears but the wife of hektor had not yet 
22,471,she heard from the great bastion the noise of mourning and sorrow her limbs spun and the shuttle dropped from her hand to the ground then 
22,504,lifted her voice among the women of troy in mourning hektor i grieve for you you and i were born to a single destiny you in troy in the house of priam and i 
22,510,now you go down to the house of death in the secret places of the earth and left me here behind in the sorrow of mourning a widow in your house and the boy is only a baby 
22,525,hitting him with his fists and in words also abuses him get out you your father is not dining among us and the boy goes away in tears to his widowed mother 
22,543,but in your honor from the men of troy and the trojan women so she spoke in tears and the women joined in her mourning book twentythree 
22,546,so they were mourning through the city meanwhile the achaians after they had made their way back to their ships and the hellespont scattered the rest of them each man to his own ship except 
22,558,them three times mourning they drove their horses with flowing manes about 
22,561,the body and among them thetis stirred the passion for weeping the sands were wet and the armor of men was wet with their tears such 
22,657,for all night long the phantom of unhappy patroklos stood over me in lamentation and mourning and the likeness to him was wonderful and it told me each thing i should do 
22,660,so he spoke and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning and dawn of the rose fingers showed on them as still they mourned about the forlorn body now powerful agamemnon 
22,705,i would give my hair into the keeping of the hero patroklos he spoke and laid his hair in the hands of his beloved companion and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning 
22,711,will obey your words there can be enough even in mourning now cause them to scatter from the fire and bid them make ready their dinner and we who are most nearly concerned with the dead 
22,741,for aphrodite daughter of zeus drove the dogs back from him by day and night and anointed him with rosy immortal oil so achilleus when he dragged him about might not tear him 
22,768,so that you may set ablaze the funeral pyre whereon lies patroklos with all achaians mourning about him she spoke so and went away and they with immortal 
22,780,and called upon the soul of unhappy patroklos and as a father mourns as he burns the bones of a son who was married only now and died to grieve his unhappy parents 
22,783,so achilleus was mourning as he burned his companions bones and dragged himself by the fire in close lamentation at that time when the dawn star passes across earth harbinger 
22,843,therefore these two horses stand here and grieve and their manes are swept along the ground as they stand with hearts full of sorrow but take the rest of you places in the field whichever achaian 
22,948,tydeus son and dashed the shining whip from his hands so that the tears began to stream from his eyes for his anger as he watched how the mares of eumelos drew far ahead of him 
22,960,and his forehead was lacerated about the brows and his eyes filled with tears and the springing voice was held fast within him then the son of tydeus turning his singlefoot horses to pass him 
23,6,dinner and of sweet sleep and its enjoyment only achilleus wept still as he remembered his beloved companion nor did sleep 
23,12,and all the actions he had seen to the end with him and the hardships he had suffered the wars of men hard crossing of the big waters remembering all these things he let fall the swelling tears lying 
23,90,was mourning the death of her blameless son who so soon was destined to die in troy of the rich soil far from the land of his fathers 
23,168,and came to the house of priamthere she found outcry and mourning the sons sitting around their father inside the courtyard made their clothes sodden with their tears and among them the old 
23,174,in it he had gathered and smeared it on with his hands and his daughters all up and down the house and the wives of his sons were mourning 
23,219,now and weep for hektor and the way at the first strong destiny spun with his life line when he was born when i gave birth to him that the dogs with their shifting feet should feed on him far from his 
23,237,then i wish that achilleus can slay me at once with my own son caught in my arms once i have my fill of mourning above him he spoke and lifted back the fair covering of his clotheschest 
23,249,all from his cloister walks scolding them with words of revilement get out you failures you disgraces have you not also mourning of your own at home that you come to me with your 
23,369,he lifted his voice and spoke aloud to priam take thought son of dardanos here is work for a mind that is careful i see a man i think he will presently tear us to pieces 
23,525,i have gone through what no other mortal on earth has gone through i put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my children so he spoke and stirred in the other a passion of grieving 
23,528,for his own father he took the old mans hand and pushed him gently away and the two remembered as priam sat huddled at the feet of achilleus and wept close for manslaughtering hektor 
23,531,and achilleus wept now for his own father now again for patroklos the sound of their mourning moved in the house then when great achilleus had taken full satisfaction in sorrow 
23,543,our sorrows lie still in the heart for all our grieving there is not any advantage to be won from grim lamentation such is the way the gods spun life for unfortunate mortals 
23,660,when my son lost his life beneath your hands but always i have been grieving and brooding over my numberless sorrows and wallowed in the muck about my courtyards enclosure 
23,738,them and now and there in front of the gates they would have lamented all day till the sun went down and let fall their tears for hektor 
23,741,except that the old man spoke from the chariot to his people give me way to get through with my mules then afterward you may sate yourselves with mourning when i have him inside the 
23,750,chanted the song of sorrow and the women were mourning beside them andromach of the white arms led the lamentation 
23,768,whose teeth bit the vast earth beaten down by the hands of hektor your father was no merciful man in the horror of battle therefore your people are grieving for you all through their city 
23,771,hektor and you left for your parents mourning and sorrow beyond words but for me passing all others is left the bitterness and the pain for you did not die in bed and stretch your arms to me 
23,774,nor tell me some last intimate word that i could remember always all the nights and days of my weeping for you so she spoke in tears and the women were mourning about her 
23,789,bow apollo has attacked and killed with his gentle arrows so she spoke in tears and wakened the endless mourning third and last helen led the song of sorrow among them 
23,807,me so she spoke in tears and the vast populace grieved with her now priam the aged king spoke forth his word to his people 
23,825,all where the fury of the fire still was in force and thereafter the brothers and companions of hektor gathered the white bones up mourning as the tears swelled and ran down their cheeks then
