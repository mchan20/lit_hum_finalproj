book 
my song is of war and a man a refugee by fate 
the first from troy to italys lavinian shores 
battered much on land and sea by blows from gods 
obliging brutal junos unforgetting rage 
he suffered much in war as well all to plant 
his town and gods in latium from here would rise 
the latin race the alban lords and romes high walls 
remember for me muse tell me the reasons what pain 
what insult to her power moved the queen of gods 
to drive a man famous for piety through misery 
on misery can such anger grip gods minds 
an ancient city built by colonists from tyre 
faced italy and tibers mouth across the sea 
wealthy carthage fierce and fond of waging war 
they say that juno loved her best even samos 
came in second here the goddess kept her weapons 
and her chariot this land would rule the world 
if fate allowed this was her aim and hope 
but shed heard that men of trojan blood 
would topple carthage and her heights one day 
theyd be a people proud in war an empire 
fatal for her libya this was what the fates had 
spun this was junos fear she remembered 
how shed fought at troy to help her cherished greeks 
still other reasons for her rage and bile 
remained deeprooted in her heart paris scornful 
verdict on her beauty the honors paid by jove 
to kidnapped ganymede her hatred for that race 
enflamed by this she barred from latium 
the seatossed trojans the few left by the greeks 
and cruel achilles they roamed for many years 
over many oceans forced on by the fates 
to found the roman race required such great effort 
sicily had slipped from sight the trojans gladly 
sailed for open sea their bronze prows churning foam 
but juno nursing her eternal wound thought 
to herself am i to leave off from my plan 
and fail to turn the trojan king from italy 
it seems that fate forbids it then how could pallas 
burn the argive fleet and drown its crew just to 
punish the mad crime of ajax son of oleus 
on her own she hurled joves lightning from the clouds 
wrecked the ships and whipped up waves with wind 
she grabbed up ajax in a gust and spiked him on sharp 
reefsthe man puffed fire from his punctured chest 
but me the queen of all the gods joves wife 
and sister too for years ive had to fight 
against a single race now wholl worship me 
or put gifts on my altars as a supplicant 
her hot heart fixed on these thoughts queen juno reached 
aeolia a land that teemed with storms and clouds 
in his colossal cave king aeolus 
ruled the warring winds and howling gales 
and locked them up inside they roared around the latches 
outraged over them the mountain murmured 
mightily aeolus sitting in his stronghold 
scepter in his hand soothed their angry spirits 
otherwise theyd seize the oceans lands 
and deepest sky and blast them all away 
it was this fear that made the mighty father 
hide them in a lightless cave and heap mountains 
on top he chose a king who swore hed curb 
the winds or free their reins as he was told 
now juno came to wheedle him aeolus 
the father of the gods and king of men 
chose you to calm the waves or whip them up with wind 
a race i hate travels the tuscan sea 
they bring the beaten gods of troy to italy 
rouse the winds to galeforce sink the ships 
or scatter them and fling the crew into the sea 
in my retinue are fourteen gorgeous nymphs 
deiopea is the loveliest of all shes yours 
just do me this favor ill join you both 
in lasting marriage so shell spend her years 
with you and make you father to fair children 
aeolus said your task o queen is to know 
your wish and will mine to make it happen 
thanks to you i have this little kingdom 
and jupiters goodwill i dine with gods 
im master of the storms and wild weather 
saying this he struck the hollow mountain 
with the buttend of his spear a battleline 
of winds rushed out the rift and swept over the lands 
notus eurus and africus full of storms 
settled on the sea as one and churned it 
from its bed they rolled huge waves to shore 
next came the shouts of men the shriek of ropes 
at once stormclouds snatched the sky from sight 
black night brooded on the sea the heavens 
thundered frequent flashes tore the dark 
all signs warned the men that death had come 
at once aeneas knees buckled with chill 
he groaned and held up both hands to the stars 
three and four times fortunate all you who died 
by troys high walls under your fathers gaze 
o diomedes bravest of the greeks 
i wish id fallen on troys fields my blood spilled 
by your strong right hand where fierce hector perished 
on achilles spear and huge sarpedon too 
where simos rolls in its stream so many shields 
and helmets so many bodies of the brave 
as he spoke the howling north wind hit the sails 
headon and pushed the sea up to the stars 
the oars snapped and the ship swung broadside 
to the waves a wall of water crashed on deck 
some sailors hung on crests some saw seabed 
as each wave loomed up the sea boiled with sand 
notus snatched three ships and hurled them onto reefs 
that lurked midsea the ones italians call altars 
huge spines near the surface eurus drove 
three boats into the shoals a sorry sight and smashed 
them on the rocks sand built up around them 
before aeneas eyes a giant wave broke on 
the ship of good orontes and his lycians 
it threw the helmsman off the deck headfirst into 
wild waters eddies spun the ship around 
three times then the raging undertow engulfed it 
a few men surfaced in the vast abyss weapons 
planks and trojan treasure floated in the waves 
the storm seized ilioneus sturdy ship 
brave achates ship abas ship and old 
aletes ship they all let in fatal water 
through the hulls loose seams and gaping cracks 
now neptune sensed the seas chaos and clamor 
the storm aeolus sent he felt the churning 
of the sluggish waters of the deep perplexed 
he raised his peaceful face and scanned the sea 
he saw aeneas wavetossed ships the trojans 
swamped by swells and the ruin of the sky 
junos angry treachery was clear to him 
he called eurus and zephyrus and said to them 
is it your noble birth that makes you bold 
you winds now dare to mingle sky and earth 
and stir up waves without permission why 
i shouldbut first ill soothe the wild sea then 
youll get what you deserve and it wont be in words 
get out of here now and tell your king 
rule over the sea and savage tridents mine 
by lot not his his kingdom is the cave 
where you live eurus let him strut in that court 
and rule thereonce his winds are jailed 
faster than his words neptune soothed the swells 
routed huddled clouds brought back the sun 
cymothoe and triton pried the ships off crags 
neptune helped them with his trident he cleared 
pathways through long shoals and calmed the sea 
skimming wavecrests lightly in his chariot 
just as riots often fester in great crowds 
when the common mob goes mad rocks and 
firebrands fly the weapons rage supplies 
but if they see a man of weight in piety 
and service they hush and wait to hear him 
he guides their minds and soothes their hearts with words 
just so all the tumult of the sea died down 
once neptune scanned the waters he turned his team 
and let them run free under cloudless skies 
aeneas tired crew fights to reach the nearest 
shore they bend toward the libyan coast 
there an islands deep bay forms a harbor 
with its sides every wave from the high sea 
is broken here and fans out to the curving coves 
on both sides sheer cliffs and matching crags 
menace the sky but underneath safe pools 
lie wide and still above a rustling forest 
sets the scene dark with trembling shade 
a cave with rocky overhangs faces the front 
it has freshwater pools and stones for seats 
the home of nymphs here no cables tie 
the weary boats no anchor bites the sand 
aeneas enters with his ships seven 
left from all the fleet with great love for land 
the trojans reach the shore they craved disembark 
and rest their sodden limbs on sand achates 
is the first to strike a spark from flint 
he kindles fire with leaves and sets dry fodder 
on the flames then feeds the blaze with twigs 
weary from their wandering they fetch the pots 
and spoiled grain they rescued from the waves then dry 
the food with fire and crush it under stone 
meanwhile aeneas scales a cliff and scans 
the spread of ocean wondering if hed perhaps see 
some trojan ships seatossed antheus capys 
or caicus shield attached to a high stern 
theres no ship in sight but three stags stray 
along the shore behind them come whole herds 
of deer the long line grazing through the gorge 
he stops and grabs his bow and flying shafts 
the weapons loyal achates holds for him 
first he drops the leading stags whose antlers 
branch on heads held high then he drives 
the panicked herd all through the leafy woods 
he only stops after hes vanquished seven 
massive beasts the number of his ships 
back at port he splits the meat among his crew 
and shares the wine which kind acestes poured 
in heavy jars when they left sicily 
a heros giftand comforts their sad hearts 
my friends were no strangers to misfortune 
youve suffered worse some god will end this too 
you slipped past savage scylla and her crags that rang 
with barks you saw the cyclops rocks be brave 
let go your fear and despair perhaps someday 
even memory of this will bring you pleasure 
through good times and bad through many trials 
we make for latium there the fates 
promise us rest there troy must rise again 
hold on save your strength for better days to come 
so he says though hes sick with crushing cares 
he feigns hope on his face and clamps down his deep pain 
they prepare the game their future feast 
hacking hide from ribs laying bare the guts 
some slice the quivering meat to thread on spits 
some set cauldrons on the shore and tend the fires 
sprawling on the grass they restore their strength 
with food gorging on old wine and fatty game 
once their hungers sated and the dishes cleared 
they ask after lost friends talking at length 
wavering between hope and fearare they alive 
or have they met their end now deaf to any calls 
pious aeneas grieves the most but secretly 
for keen orontes fate for amycus for lycus 
cruel death for brave gyas brave cloanthus 
now their grief was done jupiter looked down 
from heavens height onto the sailswept sea 
the lands and shores and farflung folk from his 
lofty seat he fixed his gaze on libya 
and as he dwelled on his concerns sad venus 
her eyes wet with shiny tears came to him 
you who rule the lives of gods and men 
a terror with your thunderbolts what did 
my aeneas and the trojansso many 
dead alreadyever do to you all lands 
are closed to them on italys account 
you promised once that theyd give rise to romans 
that in the circling years leaders would rise 
from teucers blood to rule the land and sea 
father what made you change your mind this was 
my consolation for troys fall and tragic ruin 
when i weighed one fate against the other 
now the same curse hounds them after all 
their suffering great king has their pain no end 
antenor could dodge the greeks at troy reach 
adriatic shores in safety and travel deep 
into liburnia he saw timavus source 
where the sea comes inland through nine paths 
and bursts out noisily engulfing fields with surf 
he founded padua a home for teucrians 
gave his citizens a name and put away 
his trojan armor now he lives in peace retired 
but we your blood you promised us the heights of heaven 
then betrayed us to a single females rage 
our ships are lost and were kept far from italy 
this is our prize for piety this our triumph 
smiling at her with the look that calms the sky 
and storms the forefather of gods and men 
gently kissed his daughter and replied 
let go your fear cytherea your peoples fate 
remains unchanged youll see lavinium and 
its promised walls youll raise greatsouled aeneas 
to the stars i havent changed my mind 
since this worry gnaws at you ill tell you more 
and unroll the secrets of the fates your son 
will wage wide war in italy subdue 
ferocious tribes and give them walls and customs 
after the latins lose aeneas will be king 
in latium three summers and three winters 
his son ascanius now called ilus 
he was ilus during iliums reign 
will rule for thirty cycling years of cycling 
months hell move laviniums seat of power 
and strengthen alba longa with high walls 
here when hectors line has ruled three hundred 
years the priestess ilia pregnant by mars 
will have his twins romulus clad in his foster 
mothers tawny wolfpelt will gladly lead 
his people with mars help hell build romes 
walls and name the romans for himself 
on them i set no boundaries of time or space 
ive granted empire without end even cruel 
juno terror of the land and sea and sky 
will change her plans and like me favor romans 
people of the toga rulers of the world 
so ive decreed as years slip by an age 
will come when assaracus house will conquer 
argos and crush phthia and famed mycenae 
trojan caesar will be born of lovely venus line 
whose rule will reach all shores his fame the stars 
julius a name passed down from great ilus 
freed from worry youll greet him in the skies 
hell come laden with eastern spoils and men will pray 
to him harsh centuries of war will cease 
ancient trust and vesta remus and quirinus 
will set down laws the awful iron gates of war 
will close inside impious rage crouched on 
brutal weapons tied up with a hundred knots 
of bronze will roar from bloodstained jaws 
now jupiter sent mercury the son of maia 
to make sure the lands and citadel of carthage 
would greet the trojans kindly and so dido 
blind to fate would not drive them off he flew 
across the width of sky sweeping wings like oars 
and soon reached libya he did his task the people 
quelled their fierce hearts the queen especially 
took up a calm and kindly view of trojans 
pious aeneas worried greatly through the night 
when gentle dawn appeared he decided to explore 
this unknown land to find out where hed sailed 
and learn who lived there animals or men 
what he saw looked wild then hed bring back news 
he hid the fleet inside an inlet hemmed 
by woods close to overhanging cliffs 
among the quivering shade of trees then he left 
with two broadbladed spears achates at his side 
his mother met him in midforest with a young girls 
face and dress she had weapons that a spartan 
girl might carry or harpalyce of thrace 
who tires horses and outruns the rushing river 
hebrus huntresslike shed slung a handy bow 
across her back her hair streamed on the wind 
her knees were bare a knot held up her dresss folds 
meeting them she asked young men did you 
chance on any of my sisters roaming here 
in a lynxs dappled hide holding a quiver 
or shouting on the heels of a foaming boar 
venus son replied to her as follows 
i havent seen or heard a trace of them 
but how should i address you your face and voice 
do not seem mortal goddessas you must be 
are you apollos sister does nymphblood run in you 
i hope that seeing you will ease our hardship 
what skies are these where on earth have we washed up 
tell us we dont know this place or people 
were wanderers and driven by the winds and tides 
my hand will offer many victims at your altars 
but venus said i dont deserve such honor 
we tyrian girls all sport a quiver we all tie 
the laces of our purple boots high on our shins 
you see a punic colony agenors men 
but libya unsubdued in battle borders us 
dido of tyre is our queen she left her home 
fleeing her own brother its a long and complex 
tale of wrong but heres the gist of it 
sychaeus didos husband had more land 
than any tyrian poor dido loved him greatly 
her father married them when she was still a virgin 
but pygmalion her brothera prodigy 
of evilwas the king some mad feud estranged 
the men and her impious brother blind with lust 
for gold caught and killed sychaeus at the altar 
indifferent to his sisters love for long that swine 
concealed his crime he tricked the heartsick wife 
with empty hope and spun her many tales 
but in her dreams her husbands ghost appeared to her 
unburied raising his pale and eerie face 
he showed her the cruel altar and his pierced 
chest and told her of the evil hidden in their 
home he urged her to depart their land at once 
and revealed a treasure buried long ago 
an unknown weight of gold and silverfor the trip 
shaken dido planned escape selected friends 
those who loathed or feared the tyrant gathered 
they seized whatever ships were ready loading them 
with gold the riches that the greedy man had craved 
voyaged the sea and a woman led the act 
they reached this place where you now see great walls 
and the growing stronghold of new carthage 
a region they call byrsa from their purchase 
as much land as a bullshide cut in strips could circle 
but who are you what country are you from 
where do you head aeneas answered with a sigh 
and drew his words from deep inside his heart 
goddess if i traced my story from the start 
and you had time to hear the history of our pain 
the evening star would close the day and heavens gates 
we come from what was troyperhaps its name has reached 
your ears but as we traveled many seas a storm 
drove us to libyas coast by chance im pious 
aeneas on my fleet i carry gods saved 
from the enemy my fame reaches the sky 
my blood is joves i head for italy our home 
i launched twenty ships upon the phrygian sea 
following fate and my mother showed the way 
just seven ships survive lashed by wind and waves 
and ii roam the libyan desert unknown beggared 
spurned by east and west venus was annoyed 
by these complaints and she cut his laments short 
i doubt the gods despise you whoever you may be 
you breathe the air youre near a tyrian town 
continue and youll reach the palace of the queen 
i have some news your friends are safe your fleet 
is here blown by shifting windsunless 
my parents taught me augury in vain 
see those twelve swans gladly flying in formation 
joves great eagle plunged from open skies 
and scattered them now regrouped they land 
in a long line or gaze at those whove landed 
just as theyve returned flapping their wings 
in play wheeling round the sky with honks 
so too your ships and men have entered port 
or now approach the harbor with full sail 
keep on and follow where the trail leads 
as she turned away her neck gleamed rosily 
her ambrosial hair gave off a divine scent 
and her robes grew longer flowing to her feet 
her gait too revealed the goddess but aeneas 
when he recognized his mother called to her 
why trick your son so often with disguises 
youre as cruel as the other gods why cant i 
ever hold your hand in mine or speak frankly 
grumbling so he turned his steps to town 
as they went venus veiled them in dark mist 
and draped them with a heavy cloak of cloud 
so no one could see or stumble on them 
or cause delay or ask why they were there 
she herself went up to paphos happy to 
go home where her temples hundred altars 
were fragrant with fresh wreaths and warm with incense 
meanwhile they hurried on along the path 
they climbed a hill that steeply overhung 
the town and looked down on the citadel 
aeneas admired its size once it had mere huts 
its gates the hubbub and the cobbled streets 
one group worked to raise the walls and fortify 
the citadel they rolled up rocks by hand 
some shaped homesteads circling them with trenches 
or chose a sacred senate laws and offices 
here men hollowed out a harbor there they laid down 
bedrock for a theater and hacked tall columns 
out of cliffs to ornament a future stage 
they were like busy bees in fields of flowers 
in the early summer when they lead out 
their grown young or cram the combs with honey 
and swell them with sweet nectar or unload 
returning bees or join in ranks to drive 
the idle throng of drones off from their hives 
the work hums along the honey smells of thyme 
lucky you whose walls are rising now 
cried aeneas as he stared up at the rooftops 
fenced around by mist he walked the crowded streets 
amazingly he mixed with them and no one saw 
the city center held a thickly shaded grove 
where the tyrians tossed by storms at sea 
had first dug up the omen juno spoke of 
a stallions headmeaning theyd be a race 
unmatched in war and prosperous through the ages 
here dido of tyre was building juno a huge 
temple rich in gifts rich in her godly presence 
at the entry rose bronze stairs the doorposts too 
were bronze the door creaked on bronze hinges 
in this grove first a sight appeared that eased 
aeneas fear and let him dare to dream 
of safety to have more hope in troubled times 
as he scanned each detail of the giant temple 
waiting for the queen and admired the citys 
fortune and its craftsmens skill and work he saw 
the stages of the trojan war the battles blazoned 
by their fame across the world atreuss 
sons king priam and achilles cruel to both 
he stopped in tears achates what place on earth 
what land isnt steeped in what weve suffered look 
its priam here too glory has rewards 
the world weeps and mortal matters move the heart 
let go your fear this fame will bring some safety 
he spoke and fed his soul on empty images 
sighing heavily tears streamed down his face 
he saw the men who fought by pergamum 
here greeks fled as trojan youths pursued 
there the phrygians ran and plumed achilles chased them 
in his chariot he recognized in tears 
rhesus snowy tents bloody diomedes 
had killed these men whose deep sleep was their downfall 
and taken rhesus highstrung horses to his camp 
before they tasted trojan grass or xanthus stream 
here troilus tried to get away his armor lost 
poor boy no equal to achilles in a fight 
his horses dragged him on his back tangled with 
the chariot he still held the reins his neck 
and hair trailed on the ground his spearbutt scored the dust 
meanwhile trojan women hair unbound headed 
with a robe to the temple of athena 
sad supplicants they beat their breasts but 
the hostile goddess kept her eyes fixed on the ground 
achilles had dragged hector round the walls of troy 
three times and now he hawked his corpse for gold 
aeneas groaned deep in his heart when he saw 
the spoils the chariot the very body of his 
friend and priam stretching out defenseless hands 
he saw himself as well mixed in with the greeks 
and the eastern army and black memnons spears 
penthesilea led the crescentshielded 
amazons a fighterqueen afire and ardent 
in the crush a golden swordbelt crossed below 
her naked breast a virgin dared to fight with men 
while these wonders held aeneas gaze 
while he stared at each sight riveted 
beautiful queen dido came into the temple 
a retinue of soldiers packed around her 
like diana leading dances on eurotas 
banks or cynthus peaks surrounded by 
a thousand mountain nymphs a quiver on her back 
shes the tallest of the goddesses around her 
and latonas heart is pierced with silent joy 
so dido gladly went among her people 
tending to the building of her future kingdom 
under the temples vaulted roof facing the doors 
she sat on her high throne fenced in with spears 
giving laws and statutes to the men assigning 
the work fairly or setting tasks by lot 
suddenly aeneas saw as they pushed through 
a great mob antheas brave cloanthus and 
segestus with the other trojans whom black storms 
had flung apart at sea and driven to far shores 
aeneas was stunned achates struck by joy 
and fear they were keen to greet their friends 
but these events unnerved them they stayed concealed 
veiled in hollow mist to hear the mens news 
where were their crews moored why were they here 
since in the clamor envoys picked from all the ships 
were coming to the shrine to ask for help 
when theyd entered and had leave to speak 
the eldest ilioneus calmly began 
queen whom jupiter allowed to build a city 
and to curb proud tribes with laws we wretched 
trojans tossed by storms on every sea 
plead with you to save our ships from hungry flames 
see what state were in and spare a pious race 
we dont come to plunder libyan homes 
with swords or divert stolen booty to the shore 
such brutal arrogance is not in beaten hearts 
theres a place the greeks have named hesperia 
an ancient land strong in war and rich in soil 
the oenotri settled it rumor says 
their children call themselves italian from 
their leaders name this was our heading when orions 
storms and sudden tides drove us onto lurking 
shoals and swamped us the insolent south wind 
scattered us through waves and hidden rocks 
now a few of us have drifted to your shores 
what race is this what lands so barbaric that it 
sanctions this behavior were kept away from shore 
by threats of war we cant set foot on land 
if you scorn humans and their weapons at least 
assume the gods know justice and injustice 
we had a king aeneas no one was more just 
or pious nor more powerful in battle 
if fate preserves him and he breathes the air 
not yet sleeping with the cruel shades below 
were not afraid youd be proud to match 
his kindness sicily too has towns and fields 
for us our kinsman lives there famed acestes 
let us haul ashore our windlashed vessels 
saw planks out of trees and bind together oars 
if we can sail for italy with king and crew 
then well gladly make for latium there 
if theres no hope and libyan waters hold aeneas 
best of trojans and ilus too is gone 
well return to the sicilian straits the homes 
we built and left behind and king acestes 
this was ilioneus speech all the 
dardans roared assent to it as one 
dido answered briefly her eyes downcast 
trojans let go your fear and your worries 
harsh necessity and my new kingdom force me 
to be careful and to post guards on the borders 
who doesnt know aeneas race or troy 
trojan courage and the flames of that great war 
we punics dont have minds so dull when the sungod 
yokes his team he doesnt shun our city 
if you hope for broad hesperia and saturns 
fields or king acestes and the land of eryx 
ill provide safe passage and help you with supplies 
if you wish to settle here alongside me 
the city that im buildings yours beach your ships 
both tyrians and trojans will be the same to me 
how i wish your king aeneas were here driven 
by the same south wind ill send out trusty scouts 
along the shores and have them scour all libya 
in case hes shipwrecked near our woods and towns 
brave achates and father aeneas encouraged 
by these words had long been keen to breach 
the mist around them achates urged aeneas first 
goddessborn what thoughts surge in you now 
you see that all is safe the fleet and crew are here 
one mans absent whom we ourselves saw drowning 
in the sea the rest is as your mother said 
hed hardly spoken when at once the cloud 
around them parted melting into open air 
there stood aeneas gleaming in the clear light 
godlike in his face and shoulders the goddess 
venus had graced her son with flowing hair 
the glowing skin of youth and shining eyes 
the way skill transforms ivory to art the way 
a golden bezel sets off marble or plain silver 
his appearance startled everyone at once 
he spoke to dido im herethe one you asked about 
aeneas of troy plucked from libyan waters 
o queen only you have ached for troys ordeal 
and shared with us your town and homewe few 
left by the greeks worn out on land and sea 
by every blow bereft we dont have means 
to offer fitting thanks nor do the remnants 
of the trojans scattered through the world 
may the godsif they honor pious men 
if theres justice anywhere and conscience 
reward you in kind what lucky ages 
bore you what parents had a child like you 
while rivers flow to seas and shadows cross 
the mountain slopes while sky pastures the stars 
your honor and your name and praise will last 
for me whatever country calls he grasped the hands 
of ilioneus and serestus right and left 
then others brave cloanthus and brave gyas 
dido was left speechless at the sight of him 
and all his suffering she asked what ill luck 
drives you through such danger goddessborn 
what force brings you to these arid coasts 
are you that aeneas the son of kindly venus 
and anchises born next to simos at troy 
i do remember teucer came to sidon once 
exiled from his country looking for new lands 
with belus help my father then was sacking 
wealthy cyprushed just conquered it 
since then ive known about the fall of troy 
your name and the pelasgian kings teucer himself 
though your enemy praised the trojans highly 
he claimed he came from ancient trojan stock 
so come young men enter my home fortune once 
harassed me with hardship like your own at last 
the fates let me settle in this land knowing 
pain i can learn to help the pain of others 
as she led aeneas to her royal halls 
she called for sacrifice in honor of the gods 
just as thoughtfully she sent the sailors 
on the shore twenty bulls and one hundred 
giant boars with bristling backs a hundred fatty 
lambs and ewes the gods rejoiced at the gifts 
inside the palace was prepared with regal splendor 
and the feast was set out in the center there were 
cloths embroidered skillfully in purple 
silver vessels on the tables and engraved 
in gold her ancestors brave deeds a lengthy list 
of countless heroes exploits since her peoples start 
paternal love did not allow aeneas to rest 
he sent achates quickly to the ships to tell 
ascanius the news and bring him to the city 
as a father all his care was for his cherished 
son he also told achates to bring presents 
saved from ruined troy a cloak stiff with golden 
thread a veil edged with saffrondyed acanthus 
argive helens finery taken from mycenae 
when she left for troy and her illicit marriage 
her mother ledas gorgeous gifts also 
a scepter that once belonged to priams 
eldest daughter ilione a necklace set 
with pearls a crown ringed twice with gold and gems 
achates headed for the ships wasting no time 
but venus was reflecting on new plans and plots 
how amor could change his looks and take the place 
of sweet ascanius sparking the queen to madness 
with his gifts folding flames into her marrow 
she feared a dual house and forktongued tyrians 
and junos cruelty chafed at her with night her cares 
returned so she addressed her son winged amor 
my son my strength my refuge the one source 
of my power who scorns the giantslaying bolts 
of jupiter i beg you as a supplicant 
youre aware of how aeneas your halfbrother 
is harassed on land and sea by jealous junos 
rage and youve often grieved over my grief 
now phoenician dido has him she delays him 
with her flattery i fear how junos welcome 
will turn outshe wont be slow to seize her chance 
my plan is to outwit her ill circle dido 
with a blaze beyond the reach of any god 
shell be mine bound by deep love for aeneas 
hear my thoughts on how to do this the prince 
my greatest care now leaves for sidons colony 
at his loving fathers call with gifts 
the sea and trojan flames did not destroy 
ill put the boy to sleep and hide him high 
on cythera or in my holy shrine in cyprus 
so he wont know the scheme or stumble on it 
take his shape for just one night boy for boy 
craftily put on his wellknown face so that 
when delighted dido takes you on her lap 
while wine flows at the royal feast while she holds you 
planting her sweet kisses on you youll breathe 
hidden flames and secret poison into her 
amor listened to his dear mother took off 
his wings and gladly tried out ilus gait 
venus poured calm sleep into ascanius 
and took him warm in her embrace up to 
her shrines high groves where gentle marjoram 
surrounded him with flowers and sweet shade 
now amor left as told gladly taking regal 
presents to the tyrians achates led him 
he found dido sitting in the central hall 
on a golden couch with splendid rugs 
and now aeneas and the trojan men arrived 
they reclined on purple coverings 
slaves fetched water for their hands set out 
bread in baskets and offered silky napkins 
fifty female houseslaves were in back to keep 
the larder stocked and orderly and tend 
the fires two hundred other men and women 
matched in age brought out the food and goblets 
tyrians came too crowding through the festive 
threshold invited to recline on ornate couches 
they admired aeneas gifts and they admired 
ilus the gods bright face and lying words 
poor dido above all marked for future ruin 
couldnt sate her soul the sight set her on fire 
the boy the presents charmed her equally 
ilus hugged aeneas and clung to him filling 
his false fathers heart with love then he sought out 
the queen her eyes her heart were fixed on him 
she stroked him on her lapunhappy dido 
not knowing the trap the great god laid mindful 
of his mother amor bit by bit erased 
sychaeus trying to revive new love 
in a heart so long asleep so long unused 
at the first lull in the feast tables were cleared 
great winejars set up and ringed with wreaths 
the house was filled with noise voices ricocheted 
around the vaulted halls lighted lamps hung from 
gold chains the tapers flames routed the night 
the queen called for a bowl heavy with gems and gold 
which belus and his heirs had always used 
she poured in unmixed wine a hush fell as she prayed 
jupiter they say you set the laws for hosts 
may this day be glad for those from troy 
and for the tyrians let our children mind it 
may bacchus who brings joy attend and good juno 
tyrians honor and support our union 
dido poured a gift of wine upon the altar 
the first to touch the goblet to her lips 
then challenged bitias no slouch he drank 
the foaming cup swilling from the gold 
next the other princes longhaired ipas 
great atlas pupil plucked his gilded lyre 
he sang of lunar cycles eclipses of the sun 
the origins of man and beast and rain and fire 
the star arcturus the wet hyades and twin 
bears why winter suns are quick to dip 
into the ocean what makes cold nights linger 
the tyrians doubled their applause the trojans too 
doomed dido too was drawing out the night 
with varied talk but the cup she drained was love 
she had many questions about hector priam 
the armor memnon had when he arrived 
diomedes horses and achilles strength 
better yet tell us from the start my guest 
the story of greek treachery your peoples ruin 
and your travels its the seventh summer now 
that youve roamed through all the lands and seas 
book 
they all fell silent fixing their eyes on aeneas 
from his seat of honor he began queen 
you ask me to relive an anguish beyond words 
how the greeks destroyed troys kingdom and her wealth 
i saw the piteous events myselfi played 
no minor part which of cruel ulysses men 
what dolopian or myrmidon could speak 
of it dryeyed meanwhile damp night hurries 
from the sky the setting stars urge us to sleep 
but if you long so much to learn of our ordeal 
to hear in brief the tale of troys last throes 
ill speak though i shudder to recall it and 
recoil in grief 
broken by war snubbed by fate 
the greek leaders had seen many years slip by 
they built a giant horse with the help of pallas 
skill interweaving ribs with planks of pine 
they claimed it was an offering for their safe return 
that rumor spread but they filled the horses hidden 
flanks with soldiers picked by lot the massive 
womb was packed with warriors and weapons 
theres an island tenedos in sight of troy 
famed and wealthy once while priams troy still stood 
now its just a bay with treacherous mooring 
the greeks sail there and hide on a deserted beach 
we think theyve left sailing for mycenae 
on the wind all troy shakes off her lengthy grief 
the gates are opened and we go with joy to see 
the empty doric camps the deserted shore 
here thered been dolopians and cruel achilles 
tent the fleet moored there there the front lines fought 
some gape at the gift our ruin to unwed 
athena amazed at its size thymoetes 
urges us to bring it in and set it on 
the citadel perhaps this is treason perhaps 
our destiny capys and anyone with sense 
says to hurl this trap this suspect gift of greeks 
into the sea or set a fire under it 
or bore into its hollow womb to probe inside 
the crowd is undecided we split into two camps 
then laocon a huge mob in his wake 
runs down in a hurry from the city heights 
still far he shouts poor trojans are you mad 
you think the enemy has sailed away are greek 
gifts free of guile is that ulysses nature 
either enemies are hidden in the wood 
or else this thing was built to breach our walls 
to watch our homes and city from above 
some trick lurks here citizens dont trust the horse 
i fear greeks even bringing offerings 
with all his force he flung a giant spear 
at the jointed curving belly of the beast 
it stuck there quivering the hollow space 
inside the womb responded with a groan 
and if the gods and fate had not been hostile 
wed have breached the argive lair with swords 
troy and priams citadel would still be standing 
now a group of dardan shepherds in an uproar 
dragged a man to priam hands bound behind his back 
they didnt know hed let them stumble onto him 
that he planned to throw troy open to the greeks 
he was poised and ready for two outcomes 
to ply his tricks or meet a certain death 
trojans rushed from everywhere crowding round 
the captive keen to see and jeer the loudest 
now hear how the greeks baited their trap and from 
one act of treachery understand them all 
jostled and unarmed facing all our stares 
he stood and gazed round at the phrygian ranks 
and groaned what land what sea can save me now 
what fates in store after my suffering 
i have no place among the greeks and worse 
the hostile trojans want my blood with this lament 
he changed our minds and checked our impetus 
we prompted him to tell us who he was what news 
he had why he might hope for pity though a captive 
finally he set aside his fear and spoke 
king ill tell you everything all the truth 
come what may i wont deny im greek 
ill say this first if wicked fortunes ruined 
sinon she wont make him an empty liar too 
has some news of glorious palamedes 
belus son yet reached your ears he spoke out 
against the trojan war so the argives killed him 
on false charges though he was innocent 
now they mourn the man they robbed of light 
he was our relative and when i was a boy 
my pauper father sent me as his page 
while power lent him safety and he prospered 
in the royal council i too had some fame 
and honor but when he left the shores of life 
thanks to sly ulysses malice you know it well 
i wore out my life in grief and shadows 
livid at the murder of my blameless friend 
madman that i was i didnt hold my tongue 
i swore vengeance if we won the war 
and i got home to greece my words roused hate 
my first slip on ruins path from then on 
ulysses terrified me with his accusations 
and spread rumors to the army to get allies 
for his plot he didnt rest till calchas helped 
but why tell a tale that no one wants to hear 
why play for time if all greeks are the same and you 
know im greek kill me now the ithacan 
would love it the atridae would pay handsomely 
now we burned still more to hear what happened 
blind to this great evil to greek skill in lies 
he went on shaking with contrived emotion 
the weary argives often wanted to break camp 
to leave the endless fighting and abandon troy 
how i wish they had but harsh weather kept them 
from the sea and the south wind scared them 
every time they launched once this horse of maple 
planks was built storms thundered across the sky 
worried we dispatched eurypylus to quiz 
apollos oracle he brought us back grim news 
greeks when you first came to trojan shores 
you pacified the breezes with a virgins blood 
only blood will get you back to greece offer 
a greek life when the army heard this news 
we were stunned our blood ran chill with fear 
who had the fates selected who did apollo want 
then the ithacan dragged out the prophet calchas 
and told him to reveal the gods intent many 
warned me even then about the cruel crime 
ulysses planned but though they saw it coming 
they kept quiet ten days the seer sat silent 
in his tent he would not pick a man to die 
at last driven by ulysses threats he spoke 
and marked me for the altaras theyd planned 
all agreed the death each feared for himself 
was bearable when shunted onto one poor wretch 
the awful day arrived the rites were readied 
grain was salted bands were tied around my temples 
i broke free i confess it i cheated chains and death 
and spent the night concealed in swampy rushes 
lurking till theyd leftif by chance they would 
now ive no hope to see my former homeland 
my darling children or my longedfor father 
whom the greeks may punish for my flight 
avenging my offense by killing those i love 
i beg you by the gods above by the powers 
that know truth by whatever trust still stands 
unsullied among humans pity my ordeal 
and a soul that suffers so unfairly 
these tears won him life and even pity 
priam himself had the chains that bound 
his hands and feet removed and spoke kind words 
whoever you may be forget the greeks youve lost 
youll be one of us just tell me the truth 
why did they build this giant horse who made it 
and what for an offering or a siege 
sinon schooled in falsehood and greek guile 
raised his hands now free of chains up to the sky 
and cried i call to witness the eternal flames 
and sacred powers the altar and the cruel 
sword i fled the holy bands i wore as victim 
its right to break my sworn oath to the greeks 
its right to hate those men and bring to light 
all that they hide no homeland no laws hold me 
troy if i speak truth if i repay you richly 
then keep your pledge save me as i save you 
from the start the argives every hope their trust 
in victory depended on athena but when 
godless diomedes and that architect 
of crime ulysses crept into her shrine to steal 
pallas fateful likeness killed the guards 
seized the sacred statue and dared defile 
the goddess headbands with their bloody hands 
greek hopes waned receded ebbed away 
their strength is crushed the goddess is estranged 
pallas gave signs of this with clear omens 
hardly was the statue set in camp when flames 
shot blazing from its staring eyes its wood 
poured sweat and incredibly pallas herself 
sprang up three times brandishing her sword 
and quivering spear at once calchas told us 
that we had to leave and brave the seas our swords 
would not raze troy without new signs from greece 
we had to pacify the gods wed traveled with 
in our curved keels so theyre sailing to mycenae 
to rearm and get good omens theyll be back 
just when you dont expect them this was calchas reading 
they built the horse on his advice to atone 
for the palladium and the offended goddess 
he ordered them to raise a towering mass 
of woven planks that reached up to the sky 
so big it couldnt pass your gates into the city 
and save you now that the palladium is gone 
if your hands pollute athenas offering 
then utter ruin will bring down priams empire 
may the gods turn back the omen on the seer 
but if you help the horse climb to the citadel 
asia will bring great war to pelops walls 
and ruin will fall on our children instead 
through this trap this skillful lying sinons story 
won us over we were captured by forced tears 
and falsehoodswe whom diomedes and achilles 
ten years a thousand ships had failed to conquer 
now another crisis still more terrifying 
struck our suffering people panicked our blind hearts 
laocon chosen by lot as neptunes priest 
was slaughtering a huge bull at the altar 
suddenly twin snakes from tenedos 
i shudder at the tellingheaded for the shore 
their giant coils cutting through calm waters 
their chests and bloodred crests raised high over 
the surface behind their tails skimmed the sea 
giant slinky corkscrews leaving a huge wake 
the sea foamed and splashed then they were ashore 
their eyes were flaming shot with blood and fire 
as they hissed they licked their jaws with flicking tongues 
our blood drained and we scattered from the sight 
they made a beeline for laocon first 
they twisted round his two sons tiny bodies 
feeding on their helpless flesh with fangs 
then they snared the father as he ran to help 
bringing his spear they bound him with huge loops 
twice circling his waist and throat with scaly 
trunks their heads and necks rearing above 
as he tried to break their knots with both his hands 
his headbands slimed with venom and black gore 
his awful shrieks rose to the skylike the bellows 
of a wounded bull when hes escaped the altar 
and dislodged the ax halfburied in his neck 
then the two snakes glided to the shrine of tritons 
daughter and her trojan citadel and hid 
under her statues feet and rounded shield 
and now a new fear crept into our shaken hearts 
we said laocon deserved to pay this price 
since his speartip wounded sacred wood 
since he flung his profane weapon at the horse 
we resolved to take it to athenas temple 
and appease the goddess with our prayers 
we breached our wallsour ownand laid the city open 
then we set to work we laid down gliding wheels 
under the hooves and hemp ropes round the neck 
the deadly mechanism climbed our city weapons 
in its womb boys and unwed girls thronged round it 
singing hymns glad to touch the cable the thing 
slid ominously to the citadel o troy 
my land home of gods dardan walls 
famous in war four times the horse balked at the gates 
four times its womb clattered with swords 
but we pressed on careless blind with passion we set 
the fatal monster on our sacred citadel 
then cassandra told our future but no trojan 
would believe herthis was apollos will 
and we poor things on our final day of life 
decked the holy shrines with wreaths throughout the town 
the heavens wheeled and night arrived from ocean 
veiling earth and skyand the greek treachery 
with farflung shadow scattered through the city 
the trojans were silent sleep held their weary bodies 
meanwhile the greek fleet left tenedos under 
the moons complicit quiet heading for familiar 
shores the kings ship lit a beacon and sinon 
saved by gods and cruel fate secretly freed 
the soldiers from their prison in the pinewood womb 
the unlatched horse returned them to fresh air cruel 
ulysses sthenelus thessandrus gladly 
left the hollow belly on a lowered rope 
next acamas and thoas then achilles son 
neoptolemus machaon and 
menelaus then the horses builder 
epeus marauding through a city sunk 
in wine and sleep they killed the guards opening 
the gates they met their friends and joined up as planned 
it was the time when sleep first comes to weary mortals 
creeping over us the sweetest gift of gods 
but in my dreams grieving hector came to me 
weeping floods of tears looking as he did 
when dragged behind achilles chariot 
black with bloody dust his swollen ankles pierced 
by thongs how pitiable how altered from the man 
who took achilles armor as his spoils 
who lobbed trojan flares onto greek prows 
his beard and hair were matted with dry blood 
and he had the many wounds received in fighting 
for his citys walls weeping myself 
i spoke to him in grief light of our land 
troys most trusted hope why have you come 
so late what shores sent you longedfor hector 
were exhausted from the slaughter of our people 
the great sufferings of our men our city 
but who so vilely mangled your kind face 
whats the meaning of these wounds no reply 
to this no time for useless questions he heaved 
a groan from deep inside and said get out 
goddessborn save yourself from flames 
greeks control the city troy falls from her heights 
enoughs been done for priam and our country 
if pergamum could be defended id have done it 
troy entrusts her holy rites and gods to you 
take these partners of your fate and once youve crossed 
the sea build them great walls from the shrine 
he fetched the holy headbands and the everliving 
flame of vesta goddess of the hearth 
from the city there rose mingled screams of anguish 
more and morealthough my fathers home 
was set apart and blocked by treesthe noise 
grew louder wars full horror closed on us 
shaken from my sleep i scaled the highest point 
of the roof and stood straining to hear 
the sound was like a fire fanned by raging wind 
that devastates the wheat like rivers pouring down 
a mountainslope to flatten farmlands and ripe crops 
the oxens work and drag trees headlong a shepherd hears 
the noise from his rocky crag and listens baffled 
then truly how the greeks keep faith was clear to see 
deiphobus great palace fell devoured by fire 
ucalegons next door was bright with flame 
sigeums broad straits mirrored the inferno 
the shouts of men the blare of horns rose to the sky 
crazed i grabbed my sword i had no plan and yet 
i burned to band a group for war to storm 
the citadel with friends rage and fury drove me 
i felt it was a lovely thing to die in battle 
but now panthus othrys son the priest of phoebus 
slipped past the greek spears to sprint in panic 
to my door holding our defeated gods 
dragging his small grandson by the hand i asked 
panthus wheres the heart of battle wheres our stand 
at my words he groaned and said the final day 
has come for troy the hour of no escape we were 
trojans this was ilium our fame was great 
cruel jupiter has given everything 
to argos greeks rule in our burning city 
the horse stands on the citadel disgorging soldiers 
the victor sinon revels as he feeds the flames 
greeks in thousands gather at the open gates 
the most whove ever come from great mycenae 
still others man the checkpoints swords unsheathed 
a glinting line of blades prepared to kill 
our guards at the entrance have no room 
to fight but still resist and battle blindly panthus 
words and the gods will propelled me into armor 
and to the citys flames where grim fury 
and the clamor called me where shouts rose to the sky 
riphaeus and epytus a mighty fighter 
joined us appearing in the moonlight dymas 
and hypanis blended with our band and young 
coroebus mygdons son whod just arrived 
in troy on fire with passion for cassandra 
he was fighting for his inlaw priam 
and the phrygiansunhappy man who didnt follow 
his brides warnings when the god inspired her 
when i saw them gathered on fire for the fight 
i spoke to rouse them further my friends so brave 
for a lost cause if youre set on joining me 
in certain death you see the way things stand 
all the gods whose strength supported troy 
have left their shrines and altars the city you defend 
already burns lets die by plunging into war 
our only refuge is to have no hope of refuge 
this fired their frenzy we became like wolves 
prowling in night fog mere bellies driven by 
harsh hunger our pups with parched throats waiting 
in their dens we went past hostile spears to meet 
our end making our way to the citys heart 
black night swept round us dark and void 
who could describe the death and devastation 
of that night what tears could match our anguish 
our ancient city fell so long a seat of power 
there were bodies everywhere they lay unmoving 
in the streets and houses in the temples 
of the gods but we are not the only ones 
to pay with blood bravery returned to beaten 
hearts as well greek victors fell all around 
were bitter grief and fear and different scenes of death 
the first greek to meet us with a band of men 
androgeos wrongly took us to be allies 
and addressed us affably hurry men 
whats the reason for this slowness others 
search for booty and grab spoils from burning troy 
are you just now coming from the ships 
our answers strained his trust he saw at once 
hed stumbled on the enemy he stepped back 
stunned and falling silentas if hed just 
trampled on a hidden snake in prickly brambles 
then recoiled in fear as the adder reared 
in rage puffing out its skyblue hood 
like this he fell back horrified to see us 
we charged the group and fenced them in with swords 
on unfamiliar ground they panickedand we 
slaughtered them fortune favored our first clash 
buoyed by this success coroebus yelled 
exultantly my friends this is fortunes path 
lets take the way to safety that shes shown 
swapping shields and helmets with the greeks 
is it deceit or bravery who cares in war 
theyll give us their armor he took androgeoss 
blazoned shield and crested helmet as his own 
then he strapped a greek sword to his side 
dymas rhipeus and all the men did too 
delighted they armed themselves with these new spoils 
we moved on mixed in with the greeks under their gods 
we fought many scuffles in the murky dark 
we dispatched many danans to hades 
others scattered to the ships and the safety 
of the shore some scaled the massive horse 
in shameful fear to hide inside the wellknown womb 
how wrong it is to trust the gods against their will 
cassandra priams daughter was being dragged 
by her long hair from pallas inner shrine 
in vain she turned her burning eyes to heaven 
her eyes since her gentle hands were bound with rope 
coroebus could not bear the sight mad with rage 
he plunged into the fray ready to die 
we followed all of us closing ranks and rushing 
but we were overwhelmed by friendly spears 
thrown by trojans from the temple roof 
our greek crests and armor caused this wretched carnage 
then the greeks groaning angrily at our 
attempted rescue rallied from all sides and charged 
dolopians fierce ajax the atridae 
like a breaking storm when all the winds collide 
west with south and east driven by dawns horses 
and the forests shriek nereus whips the seafoam 
with his trident churning up the depths 
those wed routed by our trick and driven 
through the city in the dark of night return 
theyre the first to recognize our shields 
and lying armor to note our different dialect 
its over their numbers crush us coroebus 
is first to fall hes killed by peneleus 
at the warrior goddess altar rhipeus 
dies too troys most just and righteous man 
the gods didnt care dymas and hypanis 
perish speared by their friends your piety 
does nothing panthus nor apollos ribbons 
o troys ashes death pyre of my people 
i swear by you that as you fell i didnt run 
from risk or argive spears if my fate were death 
id have earned it like a warrior our group 
splits up i have pelias and iphitus 
one slowed by age the other by ulysses wound 
shouts near priams palace summon us at once 
and here the scale of war eclipses every battle 
and the city full of death here the god 
of war has truly gone berserk we see the greeks 
storming the palace doors their shields providing shelter 
next ladders hug the walls and men inch up the rungs 
holding shields in their left hands against missiles 
and grasping ramparts with their right when the trojans 
see the end on the very brink of death 
they break off pieces of the roof and battlements 
to use in their defense throwing down the gilded 
beams so prized by our ancestors others 
draw their blades to guard the palace doors below 
crowding round them in dense ranks our courage 
wakes again and we run to help the royal 
home relieve the men and reinforce the beaten 
there was a hidden rear entrance to the palace 
to a passage running between priams halls 
while the kingdom lasted poor andromache 
often took this path to see her royal inlaws 
unattended taking small astyanax 
to his grandfather through this i reach the roof 
where doomed trojans hurl their spears in vain 
at the roofs sheer edge a tower rises skyward 
from this you could see all troy the greek ships 
and their camp we strike this tower with our swords 
where its joints are most stressed by the many floors 
and pry it from its perch shoved over the edge 
it plunges with a crash bringing ruin with it 
crushing the greek soldiers far and wide 
but others take their place the barrage 
of rocks and varied missiles never ceases 
heres pyrrhus flashing in bronze armor 
exulting with his weapons at the entryway like 
a snake fed by toxic plants whose bloated length 
chill winter shields under the soil come spring 
he sheds his skin emerging new and shiny 
coiling his sleek length upward to the sun 
his threeforked tongue darts in and out 
great periphas and achilles armorbearer 
and charioteer automedon storm the palace 
with the scyrians and throw up torches 
on the roof in front pyrrhus makes short work 
of heavy doors he snatches up a double ax 
and tears the bronze jambs from their hinges hacks 
the panels smashes solid oak a window opens 
to the palace long halls and courts appear 
he sees priams sanctuary used by kings 
of old and armed men guarding at the entrance 
inside moans mix with sobbing and confusion 
the vaulted halls resound with womens weeping 
the clamor rises to the golden stars 
terrorstricken mothers roam the spacious rooms 
or cling to doorposts kissing them pyrrhus 
presses forward with his fathers strength no lock 
no sentries slow him down the doors collapse 
before his battering ram and fall off damaged hinges 
brute force has made a path and the greeks break in 
butcher the front guard and fill the place with troops 
they swoop in faster than a churning stream 
thats burst its banks and smashes through the dikes 
a wall of water floods the fields dragging 
herds and stalls across the land i saw bloodcrazed 
pyrrhus charge in with the two atridae 
by the altar i saw hecuba her sons 
one hundred wives and priam polluting with his blood 
the altarfires hed blessed the fifty marriage beds 
that promised many children the doors that flaunted 
foreign gold and spoilsall of it destroyed 
the greeks owned everything the fire spared 
perhaps you wonder about priams fate 
when he saw troy fallen his palace blasted open 
the enemy squarely inside the old man strapped 
his longneglected armor to his shaking frame 
a futile act and took his useless sword 
he ran to die among the mass of greeks 
in the palace center beneath the open sky 
there was a giant altar an ancient laurel tree 
leaned over it and cast shade on the housegods 
hecuba was huddled here with her daughters 
like doves driven earthward by dark storms they sat 
clinging to the gods statues in worthless hope 
when she noticed priam taking up the armor 
of his youth she cried what deadly thoughts poor husband 
make you arm yourself where are you rushing 
this is no time for such help even if 
my hector were here himself come this altar 
will save us all or well die together she drew 
the old man close and sat him in that sacred place 
now priams son polites rushes in 
fleeing pyrrhus butchery past greek spears 
through long halls and empty courtyards wounded 
with pyrrhus in fierce pursuit so close 
to catching him and pushing in the spear 
in his parents sight at last their son 
goes down his life and blood gush out together 
at this priam himself at deaths door 
cannot hold back he shouts in fury pyrrhus 
for this murder for all your outrages 
i hope the gods pay you as you deserve 
if theres any piety in heaven 
that cares about such thingsforcing me to see 
the slaughter of my son fouling a fathers eyes 
achilles whom you claim as father in your lies 
was no such enemy to priam he had respect 
for the rights of supplicants for their trust 
in him he gave me hectors pallid corpse 
for burial and let me go back to my throne 
the old man threw his feeble spear the clanging bronze 
of pyrrhus shield blocked it easily it dangled 
useless from the central boss pyrrhus replied 
then be my messengergo tell my father 
of the evil deeds of his degenerate son 
now die the old man was dragged trembling to the altar 
slipping in his dead sons blood pyrrhus grabbed 
his hair and with his other hand unsheathed 
his flashing sword he sank it in the kings side 
to the hilt this was priams end 
the death that fate had given him to watch 
troy fall in flames once proud ruler over asias 
countless lands and people he lies now on the shore 
a giant trunk without a head a nameless corpse 
then a ghastly dread came over me 
when i saw the old king gasping out his life 
from that brutal wound i froze thinking of 
my dear father and creusa all alone 
our household sacked small ilus maybe 
dead already i turned to see which men were left 
theyd all abandoned me exhausted and despairing 
theyd fallen off the roof or stumbled into flames 
i was the only one of them alive 
as i roamed through troy staring at a city 
lit by fire everywhere i saw helen 
inside vestas shrine lurking in a corner 
she feared the trojans hatred for her role 
in our defeat but also the greeks vengeance 
and the anger of her cuckold spouse a curse 
to troy and greece the hateful thing clung to the altar 
flames of rage rose in my hearti wanted vengeance 
for my country she had to die for what she did 
why should she go safely back to sparta 
and her home mycenae a triumphant queen 
why should she see her husband and her family 
tended by a throng of captive trojan boys 
and girls priam perished by the sword troy burned 
the dardan shore so often oozed with bloodfor this 
no punishing a woman brings no glory 
but this would win me praiserubbing out 
this foulness with the punishment that she 
deserves ill drink my fill of flames of vengeance 
and appease the ashes of my people 
but as i raved and blustered in my rage 
my gentle mother showed herself to me 
never before so clear shining purely 
in the dark showing her divinity 
as she appears to other gods she took my hand 
to stop me these words came from her rosy lips 
my son what great sorrow spurs this reckless rage 
why so angry wheres your love for us 
wont you go see if anchises aged and weary 
is where you left him and if your wife creusa 
and your son ascanius are still alive 
greek ranks mill all around them if not for my care 
flames would have them swords would spill their blood 
dont blame paris or helens hateful beauty 
its the cruelty of the gods thats overturned 
our wealth and hurls troy from her heights look 
ill tear away the swirling mist that dulls 
your human vision with its damp embrace 
for your part dont fear to carry out 
your mothers orders obey her advice 
here where you see a heap of ruins boulders 
torn apart and dusty smoke that billows high 
neptunes prying up the walls and bedrock with his 
giant trident shaking and uprooting the whole 
city here savage junos first to seize 
the scaean gates she furiously calls the allied 
army from the ships her sword strapped at her side 
there tritonian pallas holds the heights 
her aura and her savage gorgonshield gleam bright 
jupiter himself infuses them with strength 
and spirit himself goads on the gods against troys army 
escape my son and give up on your efforts 
ill stay and set you safely at your fathers door 
she spoke then vanished in the nights thick shadow 
awful shapes appeared and the power 
of the gods that hated troy now i clearly 
saw all ilium collapsing in the flames 
and troy once neptunes city toppled from her roots 
like an ancient ash that mountain woodsmen 
hurry to uproot they strike the wounded trunk 
with axes many times as each blow shakes 
the leafy crown the tree seems just about to fall 
bit by bit its overwhelmed it groans 
and topples leaving ruin in its wake 
the gods guide my descent and i slip through 
hostile fire spears and flames retreat before me 
when i reached the entrance to my parents 
ancient home my fatherwhom i was so keen 
to carry to the mountain heights the one 
i looked for first of allrefused to live 
or suffer exile now that troy was lost 
you should go he said your lifeblood is still 
fresh and you have your strength escape 
if the gods had wanted me to live theyd have 
saved my home its enoughtoo muchto have 
survived the sacking of the city once already 
say goodbye and leave my body lying here 
on my own ill find a greek to kill me hell take 
my spoils out of pity burials no matter 
ive delayed the end too long hated by 
the gods useless since the king of gods and men 
struck me with his thunderbolts hot breath 
so he said unmoved and would not stir 
all of us broke down in tears my wife our son 
the slaves we begged him not to drag us down 
with him or help the fate pursuing us 
he refused sticking to his plan and place 
again i rushed to arm myself choosing death 
unhappily but were there other options now 
did you think id run off father leaving you 
did a parents lips utter this sacrilege 
if the gods want troy annihilated 
if youve resolved to add yourself and yours 
to her collapse the door is open soon pyrrhus will 
come from priams pools of blood pyrrhus who 
butchers sons in front of fathers fathers at 
the altar kind mother you saved me from the swords 
and flames for this so i could see the enemy 
invade our house see my father son 
and wife slaughtered in each others blood 
fetch my armor men the last light calls the conquered 
lead me to the greeks ill fight this war again 
not all of us will die today without revenge 
again i fastened on my sword lifted my shield 
by its strap and went to leave but at the door 
my wife crumpled to my feet and held up little 
ilus if youre going to your death she said 
take us to die with you but if the past has shown 
that you can trust your weapons guard this house first 
youre deserting your small son your father 
and your future widowjust think to whom 
she was filling all the house with her lament 
when suddenly amazingly there came an omen 
as we held our son in both our arms and grieved 
a soft light seemed to pour out from the top 
of ilus head and a harmless fire 
licked his tender curls and flickered round his face 
shaking and afraid we rushed to knock the flames 
out of his hair and douse the sacred fire with water 
but my father looked up at the stars with joy 
stretching out his hands to heaven he prayed 
almighty jupiter if any prayers move you 
look at us thats all and if our piety 
is worthy help us and confirm your omen 
at the old mans words a sudden thunder 
rumbled on our left and a shooting star 
fell from the sky and flew across the dark 
trailing flame and blinding light we watched it 
glide over the rooftops and then bury 
its bright path in idas forests just a glowing 
wake remained sulfur smoked from all the land 
now my father was defeated he rose prayed to 
the gods and hailed the sacred star no more delay 
gods of troy i follow you ill go where 
you lead us save my household and my grandson 
this sign is yours troy is in your power 
i give in my son i wont refuse to leave 
already the inferno grew louder through the city 
we could feel the rolling waves of heat 
come then dear father hold my neck i said 
ill take you on my back you wont weigh me 
down come what may well share one danger 
or one escape let small ilus stay with me 
my wife will trail our passage at a distance 
houseslaves pay attention as you leave the city 
theres an ancient shrine of ceres on a hill 
its abandoned near it grows an ancient cypress 
tended by our fathers reverence for many 
years take different pathswell meet right there 
father take the holy vessels and our gods 
ive come from lengthy battle and fresh slaughter 
i cant touch them till i clean myself in flowing 
water i issued these commands threw a tawny 
lion pelt over my brawny shoulders then bent 
to lift my burden small ilus held 
my hand keeping up with childish steps 
my wife followed us we stayed in the shadows 
and though i was so recently indifferent 
to spears and crowds of hostile greeks i was anxious 
now set on edge by every breeze and sound 
fearful for my burden and companion 
just as we approached the city gates 
and i thought wed made it safely to the end 
suddenly the sound of swiftly marching feet 
seemed to come our way and my father peering 
through the dark shouted run my boy theyre close 
i can see their flashing shields and gleaming bronze 
here some spiteful power robbed me of my wits 
i panicked and as i bolted off the path 
running from the route i knew my wife 
creusa was sadly ripped from me by fate 
did she stop get lost sink down in exhaustion 
i dont know i never saw my wife again 
i hadnt turned to find her gone or thought 
of her until i reached the knoll with ceres shrine 
here when we gathered finally one soul 
was missing gone from husband friends and son 
i lost my mind accusing every man and god 
was there a crueler blow to me in fallen troy 
i left my son anchises and the trojan gods 
with the others concealed in a valleys bend 
then i strapped my sword on turned back to 
the city i was set on risking everything 
retracing all of troy exposed to death again 
first i went back to the walls and the dark gate 
through which id left i looked for my former 
footsteps and traced them backward through the night 
horror filled me everywhere the very silence 
scared me next i went home just in case 
shed backtracked to the house the greeks had taken it 
wind fanned the hungry fire to the roof flames rose 
over everything and heatwaves warped the air 
i left then i returned to priams palace and 
our citadel there in the vestibule 
of junos empty shrine cruel ulysses guarded 
spoils with phoenix all around was trojan treasure 
torn from plundered temples altars of the gods 
golden bowls giant heaps of looted garments 
rounded up trembling mothers with their children 
stood all around in lengthy lines i even 
dared to shout into the night filling 
the streets with my unhappy cries calling 
creusa many times it was in vain 
but as i ran through all the citys homes 
searching endlessly sad creusas ghost 
appeared to me larger than i knew her 
i was aghast my hair stood up my voice 
stuck in my throat she reassured me saying 
dear husband dont give in to this mad grief 
none of this takes place without the gods consent 
its not right for you to take creusa with you 
as your wife olympus ruler wont allow it 
your fates a long exile youll plow the endless ocean 
and make it to hesperia where the lydian 
tiber gently flows through fertile fields there 
good fortune and a kingdom with a royal bride 
are yours dont cry for your beloved creusa 
i wont see the haughty homes of myrmidons 
or dolopians slave to a greek woman 
im a trojan venus daughterinlaw 
the great mother of the gods keeps me here 
on these shoresand now goodbyelove our son 
she dissolved into thin air leaving me 
in tears wanting to say so much three times 
i tried to throw my arms around her neck 
three times the ghost i tried to hold flowed through 
my handslike a light breeze or a fleeting dream 
at last the night was over and i joined my group 
here i was surprised to find a giant crowd 
of new companions whod poured in women men 
and soldiers a grieving throng escaping troy 
they came from all around with what they had 
prepared to cross the sea to any land i chose 
by now the morning star was rising over 
idas heights bringing in the day the greeks 
maintained their blockade at the gates no hope of help 
i gave up lifted father and struck out for the hills 
book 
after the gods saw fit to shatter asias power 
and priams guiltless peopleproud ilium in ruins 
neptunes troy still smoking from the ground 
omens drove us to seek exile far away 
in empty lands by phrygian idas foothills near 
antandros we toiled to build a fleet unsure where 
the fates would take us where wed settle others joined us 
summer had just started when we spread our sails 
to fortune at my fathers order tearfully 
i left the shores and harbors of my land the fields 
of former troy sailing for deep seas an exile 
with my people son and gods of sky and hearth 
far off lies a land mars loves with wide plains 
tilled by thracians fierce lycurgus ruled there 
long ago his gods and he were once troys allies 
when our luck still stood i sailed there setting 
our first town along the curving shore it was 
called aeneadae for me but the fates 
were hostile i was making offerings to my mother 
and the gods who help new ventures on the shore 
i sacrificed a glossy bull for jupiter 
there was a mound nearby with cornel shrubs 
on top and bristly myrtles with sharp spikes 
i went to tear green branches from the soil 
so i could spread fresh sprigs upon the altar 
but then i saw an awful omen beggaring 
belief when i pulled the first plant from the ground 
breaking off its roots beads of black blood 
stained the soil with gore an icy fear 
set me shakingmy terror froze my blood 
i tried again i pulled a grudging shoot 
from a new plant trying to solve the mystery 
this shrub oozed dark blood too my thoughts confused 
i prayed to the woodland nymphs and father mars 
guardian of the thracian fields to make 
the vision harmless and remove the omen 
but when i grabbed a third clump pulling 
harder bracing my knees on the sand i heard 
can i speak of this tearful groans come from 
beneath the mound a cry rose up aeneas 
must i bear your mangling too spare my corpse 
and dont pollute your pious hands im no stranger 
but a trojan and this blood is not from wood 
oh escape this cruel and grasping shore 
im polydorus here a crop of iron spears 
covered my torn flesh and grew into sharp branches 
i stopped then overcome by fear and doubt 
my hair stood on end i couldnt make a sound 
poor priam sent this polydorus his own son 
to the king of thrace to raise in secret sending 
much gold too hed lost trust in trojan weapons 
when he saw the siege around the city but 
the king once troys power was broken and her fortunes 
in decline joined in agamemnons triumph 
he broke every sacred law slaughtered the boy 
and seized the loot unholy lust for gold is there 
nothing men wont do for you 
when my terror 
left me i described the omens to our leaders 
above all my father and asked for their opinion 
all felt we should leave that evil land 
where guestrights were defiled and sail with the south wind 
we gave polydorus a fresh funeral 
heaping up a mound of earth and built him a high 
altar somber with dark ribbons and black cypress 
the women circled it their hair loose in our custom 
we fetched saucers foaming with warm milk 
and bowls of sacrificial blood to lay his shade 
to rest for one last time we called his name 
as soon as we could trust the tide when the wind 
had calmed and soft sighs called us to the sea 
we hauled the ships to shore filling the beach 
and sailed from port towns and lands receded 
theres a sacred island in the deep dear to 
the nereds mother and aegean neptune 
it roamed untethered till the pious archer 
fastened it to myconos and high gyaros 
a stable home for humans now it scorns the winds 
we sailed here its peaceful harbor safely welcomed 
my spent crew and we revered apollos town 
king anius met usking of men and phoebus 
priest crowned with holy laurel leaves 
and sacred ribbons he knew his longtime friend anchises 
we clasped hands in friendship and entered his home 
i was praying in a shrine of ancient stone 
apollo give my weary people walls a home 
a lineage and lasting city save this second 
troy the remnants left by cruel achilles and 
the greeks who will lead us where to settle 
inspire us father and provide us with a sign 
at once the surroundings seemed to shake 
the doors the divine laurels the whole hill 
the tripod boomed the inner sanctum opened 
as we sank to earth a voice came to our ears 
sturdy sons of dardanus the land that first 
produced your ancestors will gladly welcome you 
when you return to her rich soil find your 
ancient mother there aeneas line the sons 
born from his sons will come to rule all lands 
at apollos words there was a roar of joy but 
confusion too we wondered what this place was 
where phoebus told the strayers to return 
my father thinking through the tales of old 
said listen leaders heres what we can hope for 
crete the birthplace of great jove is home to 
a mount ida the cradle of our race men live 
in its hundred spacious cities and rich kingdoms 
from here if the storys right great father teucer 
left for trojan shores and picked a place 
to rule our city with her citadel had not 
yet risen and we lived in lowland valleys 
cretes home to the great motherand 
the corybantes bronze cymbals idas grove 
the silent rites the harnessed lions that pull 
her chariot lets take the path the gods commend 
well placate the winds and sail for crete 
its not a lengthy trip with jupiters goodwill 
three days will see our fleet on cretan shores 
anchises made due sacrifices at the altar 
a bull to neptune one to fair apollo a black 
lamb to storm a white lamb to helpful zephyr 
rumor had it that idomeneus prince 
of crete was exiled from his kingdom its coast was clear 
an island free of enemies with empty homes 
we left delos port and swept the sea skirting 
naxos hilltop bacchants green donusa 
olearos snowwhite paros the scattered 
cyclades islands parted by rough straits 
the sailors roared and gave it all they had we urged 
them on lets get to crete our ancestors 
a fair wind rose up at the stern behind us 
at last we beached on the curetes ancient shores 
i eagerly built walls around our longedfor 
pergamum a name that pleased my people 
i urged them love your homes build us a citadel 
and then when our boats were drawn up on dry sand 
when the men were busy with new brides and farms 
and i with giving laws and homes suddenly 
from some foul tract of sky a plague arrived 
to rot our flesh our trees our crops a time of dying 
men left sweet life behind or staggered down 
deaths path the dog star burned the barren fields 
and parched the grass the sick plants bore no fruit 
father wanted us to cross the sea again 
to beg apollos favor at his oracle 
and ask would the tired trojans ever reach 
their goal where could we find help for hardship 
it was night sleep held the birds and beasts of earth 
the sacred statues of the phrygian gods 
that id rescued from the flames of troy 
stood before my eyes as i lay sleeping 
revealed in the shining light the full moon cast 
as it flooded through the windows they spoke 
and eased my worry of his own accord 
apollo sends us to your home to tell you here 
the things hed prophesy for you at delos 
when troy was burned we took you as our leader 
we crossed the swollen ocean in your fleet 
well raise your children to the stars and give 
an empire to your city you must build great walls 
for a great race and bear your long ordeal 
your town cannot stay here apollo didnt 
want these coasts to be your home not crete 
theres a place the greeks call it hesperia 
an ancient land strong in war and rich of soil 
the oenetri settled it we hear their heirs 
now call it italy after their leaders name 
heres our proper home where dardanus 
and isius were born the founders of our people 
rise and gladly tell your father news that cant 
confuse him let him look for corythus 
and italy jove forbids the cretan fields 
i was dumbstruck by the sight and sound of gods 
it was no dream i saw them openlytheir hair 
with holy bands their faces right before me 
and i dripped with icy sweat leaping from 
my bed i raised my pleading hands to heaven 
praying then i offered unmixed wine upon 
the hearth after this ritual i gladly told 
anchises what had happened all in order 
he saw we had two parents and a double line 
hed made a fresh mistake about our ancient home 
my son so troubled by troys fate he said 
cassandra was the only one who saw this 
i remember now she said this was the fate 
foretold for us and often spoke of our italian 
kingdom in the west but whod believe in trojans 
coming to hesperia and whom could she 
convince back then lets yield to apollo and 
the better path we all obeyed him happily 
leaving this home tooonly a few stayed 
we spread our sails and skimmed across the endless sea 
once our boats reached open water with no land 
in sight just sky and ocean all around 
a black cloud lodged over us bringing night 
and storm the ocean bristled with dark shadows 
wind whipped the water into looming waves 
we were tossed and scattered in the vast abyss 
clouds rolled in to hide the sky damp night 
stole our daylight lightning split the clouds 
thrown off course we wandered the waves blindly 
even palinurus couldnt tell the dark 
from day or get our bearing in midsea 
for three uncertain days three starless nights 
we wandered in dark fog over the water 
on the fourth at last we saw a land rise up 
we made out distant hills and curling smoke 
we furled the sails and strained against our oars 
churning up foam at once sweeping across the waves 
the strophades islands took me ini was 
safely on dry land their name is greek theyre in 
the great ionian sea vile celaeno 
and her harpies had been living there 
since phineus home was closed to them 
and they fled their former feasts nothing fouler 
nothing worse has ever risen from the styx 
to show the anger of the gods theyre birds 
with young girls faces but their bellydroppings stink 
their hands are hooked their faces always pale 
with hunger when we sailed into this port we saw 
lush herds of cattle in the fields a flock of goats 
grazing the grass and no shepherds anywhere 
we fell on them with swords and called the gods 
and jupiter to share our spoils then we made some 
seats along the curving coast and ate rich meat 
suddenly the harpies were there from the hills 
a ghastly swoop of beating clattering wings 
they tore our food and fouled it all with filth 
besides their horrid shrieks the stench was awful 
we tried again at the far back of a cave 
screened by trees and skittering shadows all around 
we prepared our meal and lit the altars 
once again and again from some new place 
or secret lair the screeching throng flew round our food 
sliming it with crooked claws and filthy beaks 
i told my men to grab their swords to war 
with this vile flock they obeyed and hid their shields 
and weapons in the grass this time when 
the harpies swooped down screaming to the curving 
shore misenus blared his horn to signal 
from his lookout my men charged in for the strange fight 
they gashed the stinking seabirds with their swords 
but the harpies plumes and backs received no wounds 
they glided off in rapid flight and left behind 
their halfeaten booty and their reeking waste 
by herself celaeno perched upon a rock 
a prophetess of grief this shriek burst from her chest 
so its war you want sons of laomedon 
as thanks for our butchered cows and bulls 
you drive the faultless harpies from their homeland 
then hear my words and fix them deep inside your heart 
the mighty father told apollo this and he 
told me and i the greatest fury now tell you 
you sail for italy summoning the winds 
youll reach her and her ports will open to you 
but you wont set walls around your fated city 
until wrenching hunger and your harm to us 
will have your jaws gnawing your very tables 
she spoke and winged her path back to the woods 
but my mens blood froze with sudden fear 
courage gone they called on me to plead for peace 
not with swords but vows and prayers no matter 
if the things were goddesses or grotesque birds 
on the shore anchises called on the great gods 
his palms stretched out promising them sacrifice 
gods ward off these threats and this disaster 
be kind and protect the pious he ordered us 
to rip the mooring from the shore and free the rigging 
south winds filled the sails we fled through foamy waves 
along the path our helmsman and the winds dictated 
zacynthus woods appeared in midsea 
then dulichium sam and the sheer cliffs 
of neritos we rushed past rocky ithaca 
laertes land and cursed the soil that nurtured cruel 
ulysses soon the cloudy peaks of mount leucata 
could be seen and apollos headland feared 
by sailors weary we approached the little town 
anchored and moored our ships along the shore 
against all hope wed finally reached land 
we cleansed ourselves for jupiter burned altar 
offerings and filled the shores of actium 
for trojan games my naked comrades wrestled 
slick with oil as in troy glad to have 
evaded countless cities of the enemy 
the sun circled a full year and icy winter 
scuffed the waves with northern winds i fixed a shield 
of curving bronze that great abas once carried 
to the temple doorpost with this dedication 
aeneas gives these spoils from the greek victors 
then i had the sailors take their seats and leave 
the port eagerly they swept the sea with oars 
soon phaeacias peaks vanished behind us 
we skirted epirus and reached chaonias 
harbor then climbed on foot to steep buthrotum 
here we heard astounding news helenus son 
of priam ruled over greek cities hed won pyrrhus 
wife and scepterthat pyrrhus achilles son 
andromache was once more married to a trojan 
i was stunned and burned with great desire 
to speak to him and understand what happened 
i set out from port leaving ships and shore 
and saw andromache outside the city 
in the woods beside a second simos 
giving hectors ashes their sad yearly gift 
calling on his spirit by his empty graves 
green sod shed raised two altars in his honor 
a place for tears when she saw me with my trojan 
troops she panicked at this ghostly sight and froze 
then warmth fled her body and she fainted 
when she finally revived she asked 
is this really your face do you really bring news 
goddessborn are you alive or if lifes light 
has left you where is hector as she wept 
her laments filled land and sky in this frenzy 
i could barely get in a few words distressed 
i stammered awkwardly i do livea life 
of constant danger dont doubt what you see 
but what has happened since you lost the best 
of husbands have you met with better fortune 
hectors andromache or are you pyrrhus 
concubine her face cast down she whispered 
polyxena was the luckiest forced to die 
by troys high ramparts at achilles grave 
she wasnt given to some man a lottery prize 
she never warmed the victors bed in slavery 
when troy was burned they took me overseas 
i bore the scornful sneers of achilles son 
and gave birth as a slave then he married ledas 
child spartan hermione and gave me 
to helenus one slave to another but 
orestes enflamed with passion for his stolen bride 
driven mad by furies for his matricide 
killed pyrrhus when he caught him at achilles altar 
at his death part of pyrrhus kingdom 
went to helenus who named the fields 
and all chaonia for trojan chaon then built 
a pergamum this fortress on the heights 
but what winds or fates gave you your course 
which god let you stumble on our shore 
what of the boy ascanius does he live 
and breathe the air the son that your trojan wife 
does he love the mother that he lost 
do his father and his uncle hector rouse 
the bravery and manhood he inherited 
she poured this out in sobs stirring up grief 
in vain when priams son the hero helenus 
arrived from the city walls with many men 
he knew his fellow trojans and he gladly led us 
to his home shedding floods of tears 
as he spoke i saw a little troy a tower 
like the great one and a parched stream they called xanthus 
i embraced a scaean gate and my trojans 
shared my pleasure in this kindred city 
the king received us in his spacious hall 
in the central court we poured libations 
the food was served on gold bowls were raised for toasts 
and now one day then another passed breezes 
called the sails they billowed with the south winds swell 
i approached helenus and asked 
son of troy and spokesman of the gods you know 
apollos will his tripods and his laurels 
the stars the speech of birds the omens of 
their flight all the holy signs favor 
our voyage all the gods urge me to sail 
to italy and try for distant lands 
but the harpy celaeno has prophesied 
strange horrors warning us of dreadful anger 
and vile famine tell me the first dangers to 
avoid and how to triumph over future hardship 
helenus offered heifers in due order 
and asked the gods for peace he untied the bands 
around his holy head and took me by the hand 
up to your shrine apollo awe pervaded me 
as the seer chanted words from the gods mouth 
goddessborn its clear you sail the seas 
with divine favor the king of gods assigns 
mens fates he turns the tides of fortune and 
the world i can tell you some small part of this 
so youll safely cross calm seas and dock 
in an italian port fate forbids my knowing 
everything and juno stops my telling it 
first italy in your ignorance you plan 
to sail into her ports thinking shes nearby 
but theres no direct heading no way around 
long coasts before you build your city on safe 
land you must pull your oars in the sicilian 
sea then italys salt waters avernus lake 
and aeaea circes island must be crossed 
so store these signs deep in your memory 
when a huge sow meets your worried eyes 
by a lonely stream with oaklined banks 
lying on the ground with thirty in her litter 
the piglets at her teats all white herself white too 
that place will be your city and an end to hardship 
dont fear youll eat your tables in the future 
follow fate apollo will come when you call 
but the lands and coasts of italy that neighbor 
us and that our own seas wash avoid them 
all the towns are held by evil greeks 
the locri of naryca built their walls 
close by idomeneus army holds salentos 
plains meliboean philoctetes rules 
little petelia safe in her walls 
when your ships have reached the other coast 
once theyre moored and youve put altars on the shore 
to pay your vows veil your head under 
your purple cloak to see a hostile visage 
as the sacred fire burns will ruin the omens 
observe this custom in your rites you and your men 
let your sons of sons keep it with purity 
but when the breezes blow your boats along 
sicilian shores and pelorus straits grow wide 
take a lengthy detour tack left by land and sea 
avoid the coast to starboard they say these lands 
were once a single mass later convulsed 
by violence they leapt apart the lengthy course 
of time can cause such massive change the sea 
flooded in and severed italy 
from sicily it rushed between the fields and cities 
parted by new shores and narrow foaming straits 
scylla guards the right side ruthless charybdis 
the left three times a day it gulps a mass of water 
to the lowest spiral in its depths 
then spurts it to the sky lashing stars with spray 
scyllas lair is a dark cave from here 
her mouths emerge to drag ships onto rocks 
what you see at first is human to the waist 
a girl with lovely breasts below this theres 
a seamonster with wolves around its belly 
finally a fishtail bend around pachynus 
headland though a long and circling journey rather 
than confront vile scylla in her stinking cave 
and the crags that echo barks of seablue dogs 
also if im a seer of any wisdom 
if apollo fills my mind with truth 
ill tell you one more thing thats worth it all 
goddessborn and ill repeat it many times 
worship mighty junos power first and foremost 
with your prayers offer vows and pleasing gifts 
to win her favor this way youll leave sicily 
at last and sail in triumph to italy 
once youve reached the town of cumae near 
avernus whispering woods and sacred lakes 
youll see sibyl raving deep inside her cavern 
there she sings the fates and stores her words 
on leaves she puts in order what she wrote 
and locks it in the cave where the leaves stay still 
and keep their place but when the door swings open 
and a gentle breeze disturbs them buffeting 
the weightless fronds she never thinks to catch them 
as they fly around the cave nor to put them 
back in place fitting verse to verse so men 
depart no wiser and they hate the sibyls home 
dont fear that this delay will be too costly even 
if your men complain and the voyage calls 
the canvas to the deep as fair winds fill the sails 
meet the sibyl plead with her to chant 
her oracles herself and to set free her voice 
shell describe the tribes of italy the wars 
to come how to bear or bypass each ordeal 
if you honor her shell bless you with fine sailing 
so much i can say in my own voice now go 
and raise great troy to heaven by your acts 
when the seer had spoken these kind words 
he sent gifts of gold and chiseled ivory 
to the ships he filled the hulls with silver 
copper basins from dodona a triplelayered breastplate of gold chain mail 
and a striking coneshaped helmet with 
a horsehair crestneoptolemuss armor 
my father got gifts too along with horses 
guides and rowers and weapons for my men 
meanwhile anchises had us rig the sails 
not a minute of delay if fair winds blew 
apollos prophet hailed him with great honor 
anchises fit to share proud venus bed 
loved by gods twice saved from trojan ruins 
heres italy seize her at full sail 
but avoid her coastline on this side 
the part apollo offers you is further 
its your luck to have a pious son 
now go i waste the surging winds by speaking 
andromache was also sad at this last parting 
she brought out garments sewn with gold embroidery 
and a trojan cloak for ilus just as lovely 
heaping him with gifts of cloth she said take these 
too my boy theyre testimony to my craft 
and the lasting love of hectors wife 
andromache accept these last gifts of your people 
you my sole surviving image of astyanax 
his eyes his hands and mouth were just the same 
and now hed be a young man of your age 
i wept as i spoke my parting words 
live well you whose fate has been fulfilled 
while we are called from destiny to destiny 
youve won your relief theres no sea to plow 
no fields of italy to seek as they recede 
i pray that you have better fortune in your 
second xanthus and the troy built by your hands 
may the greeks never encounter them 
if i ever reach the tiber and its fields 
and see the ramparts granted to my race 
one day well make a single troy in spirit 
from our sister cities joining italy 
to epirus we share our founder dardanus 
and our sad past this can be our childrens task 
back at sea we skimmed ceraunias cliffs 
the shortest path to italy by ship the sun 
was setting and the hills darkened with shadow 
that night we sprawled along the shore cradled by 
the longedfor land and drew lots for the next days oars 
scattered on the beach we ate and bathed 
sleep soothed our tired limbs nights chariot 
driven by the hours was not yet near her apex 
when zealous palinurus rose to check the winds 
and listen to the breezes noting every star 
that crossed the silent night the rainy hyades 
arcturus the twin bears orion armed in gold 
seeing all was well across the clear sky 
he blared his bugle from the stern we broke up camp 
took to sea and spread our sails wide wings 
blushing dawn had set the stars to flight 
when far away we saw some hazy hills 
italys low profile italy achates 
cried out first italy the crew shouted 
in joy anchises filled a giant bowl with wine 
and crowned it with a garland he took a stand 
on the high stern and called upon the gods 
o gods who rule the land and sea and storms 
grant us an easy passage send fair breezes 
the winds picked up and soon we saw a harbor 
with a temple of minerva on the heights 
we trimmed the sails and turned the prows to land 
eastern tides had carved the bay into an arc 
it projected rocky walls that foamed with salty 
spray the temple set back from the shore was not 
in sight but two cliffs sent out bluffs like open arms 
here i saw four horses our first omen 
snowy white they grazed across the fields 
anchises cried new land you bring us war 
horses wear wars gear this herd threatens war 
yet horses can be trained to pull a chariot 
and wear a harness theres a hope of peace 
now we invoked pallas sacred power 
goddess of the battleclash the first to greet us 
in our joy then we veiled our heads with trojan 
robes and burned due gifts at argive junos altar 
the honor helenus had ordered us to pay 
our prayers duly said at once we turned 
the yardarms and their sails to the wind 
and left these risky lands settled by greeks 
we saw the gulf of tarentum hercules city 
if the storys true then junos shrine loomed up 
and caulons fort and scylaceum wrecker 
of ships from far we saw sicilian etna 
we heard the ocean roaring loudly and waves 
breaking on rocks and crashing on the shore 
the shallows boiled around us the tide swirled with sand 
my father shouted this must be charybdis 
helenus told us of those cliffs and jagged rocks 
save yourselves my friends pull hard on the oars 
they did as told and quickly palinurus 
was the first to twist his groaning prow to sea 
the fleet tacked leftward using oars and wind 
a curved wave thrust us to the sky then sank 
as it fell we plunged down to the depths of hades 
three times the cliffs and rocky caves boomed out 
three times the spray erupted splattering the stars 
now both wind and day abandoned us lost 
worn out we drifted to the cyclopes shore 
the harbor there is vast and still sheltered 
from the wind but etna roars with terrible 
eruptions nearby at times she spews black fog 
that smokes with tar and redhot ash and hurls up 
fiery spheres that lick the stars at times 
she belches boulders the mountains mangled entrails 
or throws great hissing globs of molten lava 
up to the sky her plunging crater seethes and bubbles 
the storys that enceladuss body scorched by 
lightning stretches crushed under this mass over 
him huge etna exhales fire from the fissures 
in her cauldron when he shifts his weary side 
all sicily spasms and creaks smoke blocks out 
the sky that night hidden in the woods 
we rode out monstrous terrors we couldnt see 
what made the soundsthere were no stars 
nothing luminous just clouds in pitchblack sky 
the witching hour engulfed the moon in fog 
day broke and the suns first rays appeared 
dawn dispelled damp shadows from the sky 
suddenly a stranger staggered from the forest 
he was ragged and emaciated barely 
human he approached us on the shore 
extending pleading arms we stared at the reeking 
man the matted beard the clothes fastened by thorns 
and yet he was a greek once sent to troy to fight us 
when he saw our trojan clothes and armor 
from afar he froze in terror for a moment 
then rushed madly for the beach sobbing 
and imploring us i beg you by the gods 
and stars by the bright air that we breathe 
take me with you trojans anywhere is fine 
ill be content i know i sailed in the greek fleet 
i confess i fought against troys gods 
if this was such an awful crime scatter my body 
in the waves drown me in the endless sea 
if i die at least i die by human hands 
he grabbed my knees and clung there cringing at my feet 
we urged the man to tell us who he was 
his lineage the story of his suffering 
anchises himself didnt wait but gave the man 
his hand cheering him with this clear pledge 
finally he set aside his fear and spoke 
im ithacan unfortunate ulysses friend 
achaemenides the pauper adamastus 
son i wish id stayed poorbut troy called to me 
the crew forgot me here in a cyclops dismal 
cave when they fled this grisly place 
inside its dark and vast all gore and bloody 
meat the man himselfs a gianthis head bumps 
the stars gods keep this monster from our lands 
hes too ugly to be seen not great at talk 
he lives off his victims entrails and black blood 
with these eyes i saw him grab two of our men 
as he lounged inside his cave he broke 
their bodies on the rocks the entrance swam 
with sprays of blood i saw him chew the corpses 
as they oozed black gorethe stillwarm bodies twitched 
but he paid ulysses wouldnt stand for it 
he kept a cool head even in this crisis 
when the cyclops stuffed with food and sunk in wine 
laid down his lolling head and sprawled his bulk 
across the cave to sleep belching gobs of gore 
and bloody wine we prayed to the great gods 
then drew lots surrounded him as one 
and pierced his giant eye with a sharpened stake 
that eye which lurked alone under his scowling brow 
like a greek shield or apollos sun we were 
happy to avenge our comrades ghosts at last 
but you must get away from here poor fools run 
rip your mooring from the shore a hundred other 
grim cyclopes just like polyphemus 
they pen their woolly sheep inside their caves 
and milk their udders theyre just his size and shape 
live above this curving shore in the high hills 
three times the full moons risen while ive dragged 
my life out in the forests and the hidden lairs 
of beasts i watch them from a cliff and shudder 
at their voices and their stomping feet 
i get a meager living from the treesberries 
and hard nutsor i rip out grass to eat 
i scan my surroundings yours is the first fleet 
ive seen approach these shores do what you want with me 
im yours if i can just escape this evil tribe 
you cut short my life instead i dont care how 
right then we saw the shepherd polyphemus 
himself on a hilltop moving his vast bulk 
among his flock and heading for the shores he knew 
a gross misshapen massive monster with no eye 
he used a pine trunk as a staff to guide his steps 
with him were his woolly sheep his only joy 
the only consolation for his fate he plunged 
into the deeper water past the waves and washed 
the blood that dribbled from his empty socket 
grinding his teeth groaning then he walked out 
deeper still the water didnt reach his hips 
we were anxious to escape at once and take 
our worthy supplicant quietly we cut 
the ropes and bent to oars churning up the water 
the cyclops heard and turned toward the sound 
but he had no way to capture us no strength 
to match the pull of the ionian sea 
he roared so loudly that the oceans waves all 
trembled italy was frightened far inland 
and etnas curving caves boomed in response 
the cyclopes heard him they rushed to the harbor 
from the high hilltops and woods and packed the shore 
we saw the brotherhood of etna stand there 
helplessly each with one grim eye an awful 
gathering their heads struck clouds like oaks whose crowns 
reach to the sky or coneclad cypresses 
in jupiters deep forests and dianas grove 
sharp fear drove us headlong we set the ropes 
for any tack that filled the sails with favoring wind 
helenus had advised me not to steer through 
scylla and charybdis where the slightest slip 
on either side meant death we wanted to reverse 
but just then a north wind rose from narrow cape 
pelorus we passed pantagias rocky delta the bay 
of megara lowlying thapsus these were the shores 
that achaemenides luckless ulysses friend 
showed to us as we retraced his trip 
an island once known as ortygia spans the bay 
of syracuse facing wavewashed plemyrium 
they say the stream alpheus started here and flowed 
below the sea unseen now it mixes 
with sicilian waves at arethusas delta 
we worshipped the local deities as ordered 
then passed the fertile soil of helorus marsh 
next we scraped by pachynus high cliffs 
and jutting rocks camerinas there fate 
wouldnt let her move away and the fields 
and town of gela named after its rushing river 
steep acragas displayed massive walls from far 
a place that raises stallions of great spirit 
as the winds picked up i passed selinus palms 
we skirted lilybaeums shoals and hidden reefs 
drepanums port and shore of sorrow took us in 
here after so many storms at sea i lost 
my father anchisesmy help in every care 
and crisis best of parents rescued in vain from great 
jeopardy you abandoned your tired son 
helenus though he warned of many horrors did not 
predict this grief for me nor did grim celaeno 
this was my last hardship the end of my long travels 
when i left the god sent me to your shore 
such was the godsent fate aeneas told 
his spellbound audience such his voyage 
ending it at last like this he fell silent 
book 
but loves pain had already pierced the queen 
she fed it with her lifeblood the hidden flame 
consumed her aeneas courage and his noble 
birth haunted her thoughts his face and words 
lodged in her heart love let her find no rest in sleep 
as dawn lit up the land with phoebus torch 
and drove damp shadows from the sky dido 
turned in anguish to her second self her sister 
anna she said such nightmares torment me 
who is this stranger sheltered in our home 
how proud and brave he is and what a warrior 
i think and with good cause that hes the child of gods 
fear shows up lesser men how cruelly fate 
has treated him what wars he fought and sang of 
if i hadnt sworn firmly and forever 
not to give myself to anyone in marriage 
when my first love died and stole our future 
if weddings didnt sicken me perhaps id yield 
to this one fault anna since the death of poor 
sychaeus when my brother drenched our altar 
with his blood this man alone has moved 
my heart and made me waver i recognize 
the traces of that flame i felt before 
but id sooner have the depths of earth gape open 
and almighty father hurl me down to hades 
with his bolt to the pallid shades and inky 
night before i disobey my conscience 
or its laws the man who first married me 
still has my love let him guard it in his grave 
as she spoke she soaked her chest with tears 
anna answered sister dearer than life itself 
will you waste away in grief and loneliness 
and never know sweet children venuss rewards 
do you suppose his ghost cares or his ashes 
its true no suitors moved you in your grief 
not in libya nor in tyre you scorned irbas 
and the other chieftains whom rich africa 
has fed on triumphs will you even fight a love 
that pleases do you forget where you live to one 
side invincible gaetulians have their towns 
wild numidians and cruel reefs hem us in 
opposite are arid lands where barcans 
rampage far and wide should i mention wars 
brewing with tyre or your brothers threats 
i think the trojan ships followed this heading 
with divine support and junos favor 
what a city youll see rise what a kingdom 
with this husband and his trojan soldiers 
how punic glory will soar with such wealth 
beg for the gods favor and if you get good omens 
be lavish with your guest find reasons to delay him 
while orions wintry storms rage on the sea 
while the boats are damaged and the weather harsh 
her words fed the fire of a burning heart 
gave hope to hesitation weakened shame 
at first they went to shrines and asked for blessings 
at the altars they offered chosen sheep to phoebus 
father bacchus and to ceres lawgiver 
but most of all to juno who minds the marriage bond 
lovely dido held the cup in her right hand 
and poured the wine between a snowy heifers horns 
she paced along the bloody altars and gods statues 
doubled the days offerings and read with care 
the throbbing guts of animals laid open 
but what can prophets know what use are vows 
and shrines to the obsessed the flame devoured 
her soft marrow the silent wound throbbed in her heart 
unhappy dido burned mad with love she wandered 
through the citylike a careless doe pierced by 
a shepherds arrow from afar as he roams 
the cretan forest with his bow unknowing 
he leaves the shaft behind she bolts through dictes 
groves the fatal arrow in her flank 
now dido led aeneas through the fortress 
and showed him sidons riches and her rising city 
faltering midsentence as she spoke to him 
now she hosted the same banquet when night fell 
and madly begged to hear his hardships once again 
once again she hung on every word he said 
when all were gone as the moons dim light died out 
and the setting stars urged her to sleep she grieved 
alone inside her empty home and threw herself 
onto his couch she saw and heard him in his absence 
or pulled his son onto her lap captured by 
the likeness hoping she could cheat her shameful love 
the towers stayed halfbuilt the soldiers did no drills 
no workers fortified the port and ramparts 
for a war projects were put off the walls 
menacing mass the cranes that reached the sky 
as soon as juno jupiters dear wife saw dido 
in the fevers grip saw her reputation 
would be no block to passion she accosted venus 
quite the prize youve won a splendid catch 
you and your boy that great divinity 
a single woman trapped by two gods tricks 
i know quite well you fear my town and hold 
the houses of high carthage in suspicion 
but what will be the end of this what will we 
achieve lets aim instead at lasting peace 
and a pact of marriage you have what you wanted 
all this while dido burns with love frenzy 
courses through her bones you and i can rule 
this land with equal power let her serve a trojan 
husband her tyrians will be his dowry 
venus realized junos words were insincere 
designed to shift italian might to libyan shores 
so she countered whod be mad enough 
to turn this down or pick a fight with you 
so long as fortune likes this plan of yours 
but i dont know fates will would jupiter 
approve a single city filled with tyrians 
and trojans mingled peoples joined by a pact 
youre his wifeyou try your prayers on him 
and ill take your lead royal juno answered 
leave that task to me now ill tell you briefly 
listen how to make our plan succeed 
aeneas and doomed dido plan to hunt together 
in the forest when tomorrows titan brings 
the dawn and bares the lands with light 
as the huntsmen run to ring the woods with nets 
ill send down a deluge dark with rain and hail 
and shake the sky with thunder the group 
will scatter swallowed by black night but dido 
and the trojan prince will come to the same cave 
ill be there and if youre sure you want this 
ill join them in a stable marriage shell be his 
this will be their wedding venus smiling at 
the tricks transparency agreed to this request 
dawn rises over oceans rim and as day breaks 
a chosen band goes from the city gates to hunt 
they have broadbladed spears for game cordons and nets 
massylian riders and keenscented hounds rush out 
the phoenician chiefs wait at the entrance 
for the queen who lingers in her bedroom 
her splendid stallion decked in gold and purple 
champs fiercely on the foaming bit at last she comes 
in a sidonian cloak with an embroidered edge 
her retinue around her her quivers gold 
gold binds her hair a gold brooch pins her purple robe 
her trojan friends approach as does glad ilus 
aeneas himself handsome past all others 
partners her and joins his band with hers 
hes like apollo as he leaves the lycian winter 
and the river xanthus going to his mothers delos 
to renew the dance at his altars cretans and 
dryopians and tattooed agathyrsi roar 
the god strides over cynthus slopes on his flowing 
hair young laurel leaves are bound with gold 
arrows jangle on his shoulder with such grace 
aeneas goes godlike beauty on his face 
when they reach the hills and pathless haunts 
wild goats disturbed from rocky heights 
go bounding down the slopes elsewhere deer 
speed across the open fields in dusty 
huddled herds and leave the heights behind 
in the valley young ascanius enjoys 
his fiery horse passing others at a gallop 
hoping to see a frothing boar among 
the docile herds or a tawny mountain lion 
meanwhile the sky begins to change loud rumblings 
bring on a sudden storm of rain and hail 
they scatter through the fieldsthe trojan men 
the band of tyrians and venus dardan grandson 
cowed and seeking cover torrents run down the hills 
dido and the trojan leader come to the same 
cave ancient earth and juno marriage goddess 
give the signal lightning flashes nymphs howl 
from the hills the sky is witness to the wedding 
this was the first day of death the first cause 
of ruin shes unmoved by rumor or appearance 
and no longer plans to hide her love she says 
theyre wed with this word she masks her fault 
at once rumor races through libyas great 
cities rumor swiftest of all evils she thrives 
on speed and gains strength as she goes at first 
shes small and scared but soon she rears to the skies 
her feet still on the ground her head hidden in clouds 
they say that earth riled to anger at the gods 
bore her last coeus and enceladuss 
sister shes fast of foot and fleet of wing a huge 
horrific monster under all her feathers lurk 
amazingly as many watching eyes and tongues 
as many talking mouths and prickedup ears 
she flies by night between the sky and earth screeching 
through the dark her eyes dont close in welcome sleep 
by day she perches as a lookout on high roofs 
or towers and alarms great cities shes as fond 
of fiction and perversity as truth and now 
she gladly fills the peoples ears with varied 
stories giving equal time to false and true 
aeneas born of trojan blood is here 
lovely dido deigns to sleep with him 
they pass the winters length in luxury 
unmindful of their kingdoms slaves to shameful lust 
the foul goddess spreads this gossip on mens tongues 
then quickly turns her path to king irbas 
what she says enflames him and builds up his rage 
this man was born to hammon and a libyan nymph 
hed raped on his sweeping land he built a hundred 
shrines to jupiter a hundred altars burned 
eternally as watchmen for the gods the ground 
oozed sacrificial gore the doors were bright with garlands 
they say he prayed at length before the divine 
images and altars maddened set afire 
by the bitter rumor he raised pleading hands 
almighty jupiter we moors worship you 
with wine when we feast on ornate couches 
do you see this outrage when you hurl your bolts 
is our terror pointless does lightning from the clouds 
land randomly despite our fear are its rumblings 
empty a woman wandered to my land she paid 
to build a paltry town i gave her shores to till 
and local laws she scorned my marriage offer 
and took aeneas in her kingdom as her lord 
and now that paris with his retinue of halfmen 
a lydian scarf tied on his oily hair enjoys 
what he stole while we bring presents to your 
socalled shrines and revere an empty name 
the almighty heard him as he clutched the altars 
praying jove turned his gaze to didos city 
and the lovers whod forgotten their good name 
then he ordered mercury go my son 
call the zephyrs glide down on your wings 
to meet the dardan leader who expects a future 
in tyres carthage and ignores the towns chosen 
by fate fly through the rapid breezes with my words 
this isnt what his lovely mother promised me 
hed be nor why she saved him twice from battle 
with the greeks he was to rule an italy 
of warcries pregnant with an empire to start a race 
from teucers ancient blood and control the world 
if this great venture and its glory leaves him cold 
if he wont labor for his own fame does he 
grudge ascanius the citadels of rome 
whats his plan why this libyan loitering 
what of italys new race and the lavinian 
fields he must sail thats my messagetell him 
mercury prepared to carry out his mighty 
fathers order first he bound gold sandals 
on his feet winged to carry him high over 
land and sea as fast as whirlwinds he took 
the wand with which he calls pale souls from orcus 
and takes others to grim tartarus gives sleep 
or denies it and opens dead mens eyes 
using this he drove the winds and skimmed 
the stormy clouds and now in flight he saw 
strong atlas summit and his sheer slopes 
his peak supports the sky dark clouds hug the piney 
crest and lash it constantly with wind and rain 
snow blankets his shoulders rivers tumble down 
his wrinkled chin his beard bristles with ice 
here mercury first landed hovering 
on balanced wings then he dove down to the ocean 
hurling his body headlong like a gull that skims 
the shores and reefs where fish abound just so 
between sky and earth the god from cyllene 
flew to libyas sandy shore parting the winds 
leaving behind atlas the father of his mother 
as his winged feet lit down by the city outskirts 
he saw aeneas building forts and homes 
the sword he wore was starred with tawny jasper 
the cloak clasped on his shoulders gleamed with purple dye 
a gift rich dido wove for him working the cloth 
with golden thread mercury accosted him 
so you lay foundations for high carthage 
building a fine city acting the good husband 
you forget your kingdom and your fate 
the ruler of the gods himself whose power moves 
the earth and sky sent me down from bright 
olympus through the rapid breezes to say this 
whats your plan why this libyan loitering 
if this great venture and its glory leaves you cold 
if you wont labor for your own fame think of 
ascaniuss future the hope of your heir ilus 
hes owed the rule of italy and the soil 
of rome when mercury had said this much 
he left the sight of mortals with his final words 
and vanished into thin air gone from view 
the vision stunned aeneas and struck him senseless 
his hair stood up his voice stuck in his throat 
aghast at such a warning and the gods command 
he burned to get away to leave that land of pleasure 
but what should he do with what words approach 
the queen who would be furious how begin 
he thought quickly weighing all his options 
trying different angles turning it all over 
as he reflected this decision seemed the best 
he called mnestheus and sergestus and sturdy 
serestus and told them to prepare the fleet without 
a wordto fetch the men to shore rig the ships and 
hide the change of plans meanwhile since good dido 
would never think their deep love could be severed 
hed try to speak to her hed pick the sweetest 
moment and the right tone for his words swiftly 
gladly they obeyed and set to work 
but dido sensed the trick who can deceive 
a lover and the launch they planned now everything 
seemed suspect even if it wasnt that same impious 
rumor told the desperate queen the fleet prepared 
to sail on fire she raved in frenzy through the city 
like a maenad roused by shaken rattles 
and the shouts of bacchus every other year 
when revels spur her on and cithaerons clamor 
calls by night at last dido confronted him 
traitor were you hoping you could hide 
this outrage and sail away without a word 
our love doesnt hold you back nor the pledge 
you made me nor the painful death ill die 
why so quick to rig the fleet when the skies 
are wintry why cross the deep when north winds blow 
how cruel if you didnt make for foreign fields 
and unknown homes and ancient troy still stood 
would you head for troy across these waves 
is it me you run from by my tears and by your 
promise nothing else is left me in my grief 
by our wedding by the marriage weve begun 
if i deserve anything from you if you 
found me at all pleasing pity my poor home 
put off your plan i beg if theres still time to beg 
because of you the libyan tribes and nomad kings 
detest me and my tyrians are hostile because 
youre leaving me my honors ruined and my one path 
to the starsmy reputation my guest this words 
the sad remnant of husband to whom do you 
abandon meto what sort of death should i 
await pygmalion my brother wholl raze my city 
irbas wholl enslave me if at least id made 
a child with you if a small aeneas played 
inside my home who looked like you despite it all 
i wouldnt feel so lonely and betrayed 
she begged but warned by jupiter he kept 
his face unmoved and with effort curbed his feelings 
at last he answered briefly queen ill never 
fault your kindness nor any act you care to list 
ill never regret the memory of you 
while i draw breath or remember my own self 
a few points in response i didnt try 
to sneak away from heredont pretend i did 
i never held a husbands torch or made that pact 
if the fates would let me live the life i wanted 
and resolve my worries as id like 
id first take care of troy and my peoples 
sweet remains priams high walls would stand 
id build a second pergamum for the defeated 
but as it is apollo and the oracles 
of lycia have made great italy my goal 
my love my land if the citadels of carthage 
and the vision of your libyan city hold you 
a phoenician why begrudge trojans their land 
in italy we too may seek a foreign kingdom 
whenever nighttime covers earth with its damp shadows 
and shining constellations rise my fathers troubled 
ghost alarms me in my dreams he says 
ive harmed my dear son ascanius by robbing 
him of western rule and fated fields and now 
the gods own gobetween from jupiter himself 
i swear on both our lives has brought an order 
through the rapid breezes i saw him in full 
daylight in the city i heard him with these ears 
stop enflaming both of us with your complaints 
i make for italy but not of my free will 
shed already turned away watching him 
askance her eyes roaming restlessly now she 
scanned him coldly up and down and burst out 
angrily traitor no goddess was your mother 
youre no dardanian the caucasus sharp peaks 
gave birth to you and caspian tigers suckled you 
why should i pretend now what could be worse than this 
did he suffer as i wept or look at me 
or yield to tears and feel pity for his lover 
where should i start now neither mighty juno 
nor the father saturns son takes care of justice 
no trust is safe i took him in a beggar cast up 
on my shore i gave him half my kingdommadness 
i saved his men from death i saved his missing fleet 
how this rage rips through me first apollo then its 
lycian prophecies then sent by jove himself 
the gods own messenger brings grim news through the breezes 
as if the gods lose sleep or worry over this 
i wont stop you or refute you go follow 
the winds to italy chase your kingdom through 
the waves if the gods of justice can do anything 
i hope reefs bring you your reward youll cry 
dido often as you drown ill haunt you with black 
flames and when cold death divides my soul and body 
my ghost will stalk you everywhere wicked man 
youll pay ill know the news will come to me in hell 
heartsick she broke off her speech and rushed 
out of his sight gone from the light of day 
she left him hesitating fearfully planning 
to say more slavewomen took her fainting body 
to her marble chamber and set her on her bed 
pious aeneas wanted to console her pain 
and soothe her grief with words yetthough his great love 
shook him to his soulhe groaned and followed 
the gods orders going to see the fleet 
now the trojans fell to work in earnest 
eager to escape they pulled the ships to shore 
set afloat the pitchsmeared keels and brought in 
leafy branches from the woods for making oars 
you could see them swarming all over the city 
like ants when they pillage a huge heap of grain 
mindful of the winter and store it in their home 
a long black stream hauls plunder through a narrow 
pathway in the grass some roll giant grains 
pushing with their shoulders others mind the line 
and chastise stragglers the pathway teems with work 
what did you feel then dido as you watched 
how did you grieve seeing from your citadel 
the bustle on the shore before your eyes 
seeing the bay alive with so much shouting 
cursed love you make us stoop to anything 
again didos forced to plead with him and weep 
to submit her pride to love and beg 
she cant leave any stone unturned her lifes at stake 
anna you see the haste along the shore 
they come from everywhere the canvas calls 
the winds glad sailors wreathe the sterns because 
i knew this suffering was possible ill be 
able to endure it just do me one favor 
in my grief since that liar was your friend 
and used to trust you with his private thoughts 
only you could catch him in an easy mood 
go talk to my proud enemy and plead with him 
i took no oath at aulis with the greeks to ruin 
the trojan race i sent no fleet to pergamum 
i didnt exhume anchises ghost and ashes 
why does he ignore my words whats his rush 
as a last gift for his grieving lover let him 
wait for easy sailing and fair winds 
im not begging for the marriage he betrayed 
or that he lose his precious empire latium 
i just need time some peace and space for passion 
until fortune teaches me to bear my loss 
i ask this final favor have pity for your sister 
if he agrees my death will pay him back with interest 
her unhappy sister takes these words and tears 
to aeneas many times but no sobs 
can move him and hes closed to any plea the fates 
oppose it and the god stops up his kindly ears 
hes like an oak its wood stronger with age 
which alpine winds try to uproot blasting it 
from every side as it creaks leaves from its shaken 
trunk lie thick over the ground but the tree sticks 
to its crag pushing its crest up to heaven 
and its roots as far into deep tartarus 
though the heros buffeted on every side 
by endless pleas and his great heart grieves 
his mind remains unmoved the tears are spilled in vain 
then unhappy dido prays for death in earnest 
distraught at her fate it sickens her to see 
the sky and strange omens fortify her plans 
when she sets gifts on the incenseburning altars 
the holy water blackens horrible to speak of 
the wine she pours turns into filthy gore 
she tells no one these sights not even anna 
and besides her home held a marble temple 
to her former husband which she honored greatly 
decking it with festive wreaths and snowy fleeces 
from this she seemed to hear her husbands voice 
calling her when dark night held the earth 
on the roof a lonely owl often cried its 
gloomy hoot dragging long notes into sobs 
many other prophecies of seers gone by 
scared her with grim warnings in her dreams 
fierce aeneas chased her she always found herself 
alone on a long road in a frenzy 
looking for her tyrians in desert lands 
like mad pentheus when he sees a throng 
of furies two suns and two thebes or like orestes 
in a play when hes chased across the stage 
his mothers in pursuit armed with torches 
and black snakes vengeful furies block the exit 
so in madness grip she decides on death 
her grief has won she secretly mulls over 
the right means and moment then she calls her worried 
sister hiding her intent her face serene 
with hope sister wish me joy ive found a way 
to bring him back or be released from love 
in distant ethiopia where mighty atlas 
whirls the starry sky upon his shoulder 
by the bounds of ocean and the setting sun 
ive found a priestess from massylia a guardian 
of the zone of the hesperides feeder 
of the serpent there who guards the sacred branches 
she sprinkles viscous honey and the sleep of poppies 
on its food she claims her spells can ease the cares 
of those she chooses and cause deep pain in others 
she stops the flow of streams turns back the orbit 
of the stars and wakes the dead at night youll see 
the earth quake underfoot and ash trees walk down 
mountains dear sister i call the gods and your sweet 
self to witness im forced to arm myself with magic 
go raise a pyre in the inner court under 
the open air add the clothes and weapons he left 
in our room impious man and the marriage 
bed that was my ruin i must wipe out every 
memory of that devil as the priestess says 
she falls silent pallor sweeps her face 
anna cant imagine that these unknown rites 
conceal her sisters deathshe cant conceive 
of such insanity she fears nothing worse 
than when sychaeus died so she follows orders 
the pyre stands in the inner court under the sky 
piled high with pine and oak the queen adds wreaths 
and crowns it with dark foliage on their bed 
she puts his clothes his picture and the sword he left 
she knows whats next altars stand around the pyre 
the priestess with loose hair shrieks the titles 
of three hundred gods erebus and chaos 
and triform hecate dianas triple faces 
she scatters drops to symbolize avernus water 
and herbs cut down at moonlight with bronze sickles 
bursting with the milk of inky poison 
and the warty love charm from the forehead 
of a foal torn off before its mother took it 
dido holding holy grain in pious hands 
stands by the altar in one sandal her robes loosened 
she calls upon the gods and stars that know her fate 
then she prays to any divine power whos just 
and mindful and cares for unrequited love 
darkness falls through the land weary creatures 
wallow in sweet slumber a hush is on the woods 
and restless seas the stars have circled halfway 
through their path and every field is still the beasts 
and brighthued birds who live among the clear lakes 
or nest in thorny shrubs sleep in the silent night 
but not heartbroken dido who cant ease into rest 
who cant let night into her eyes or heart 
the pain only grows worse her love surges again 
her great anger ebbs and flows she broods over 
her worries turns them over in her heart 
what now should i go back to my old suitors 
like a fool and beg to be a nomad wife 
though i rejected them so many times before 
should i board the trojan fleet and fill 
their every wish as if they were grateful 
for my help or remembered my warm welcome 
and if i asked they wouldnt let a hated woman 
on their haughty ships poor thing dont you 
know or feel the treachery of trojans yet 
i could leave alone and join the swaggering 
sailors or take my tyrians and my household 
with me ordering the group i barely 
tore from sidon to set sail again no 
die as you deserve kill grief by the sword 
sister you did this you yielded to my tears 
added ruin to my folly and betrayed me 
i could have lived in innocence unwed 
and free of grief like a creature in the wild 
i broke the vow i made sychaeus ashes 
these cries burst from didos broken heart 
while aeneas slept on his high stern 
set on going all the preparations made 
as he dreamed the same god came to him 
and seemed to warn him once again he was 
like mercury in every way his voice 
his color and blond hair a handsome youth 
goddessborn can you sleep in such a crisis 
are you crazy dont you see the dangers all 
around you or hear the helpful west wind blowing 
shes plotting treachery and terror shes set 
on death and feeds the surges of her rage 
wont you get out while you can all too soon 
youll see the water churning with her ships 
torches burning and the shore seething with flames 
if dawn finds you lingering in these lands come 
no more waiting females are a fickle thing 
always prone to change he blended with black night 
aeneas was aghast at the sudden vision 
he rose from sleep and roused his crew to action 
wake up men and man the benches hoist 
the sails at once a god sent from the upper air 
urges usagainto slash the braided hawsers 
and depart at once we follow sacred god 
whichever one you are we gladly obey 
stay with us assist us show us helpful 
starsigns in the sky he seized his flashing sword 
and struck the ropes with its bare blade the same 
fever gripped them all they rushed to rig the sails 
and leave the shore the fleet covered the sea 
rowing hard they swept the waves and churned up foam 
and now dawn left tithonus saffron bed 
to pour fresh light upon the land but when 
dido from her tower saw the first rays shining 
the fleet leaving with hoisted sails and the shore 
and harbor empty the crew gone she beat 
her lovely chest three and four times and tore 
her golden hair o jupiter will he go then 
the foreigner who jeered at my kingdom 
shouldnt we grab every weapon in the city 
and give chase hurry drag ships from the docks 
take up torches give out swords pull on your oars 
what words are these where am i whats this madness 
poor dido do his impious actions touch you now 
better then when you shared your rule so much 
for his pledges the man they say carried his gods 
and hauled his father weak with age upon his back 
i could have seized him hacked him up and thrown his body 
in the sea i could have killed his men or 
ascanius himself and served him to his father 
i might have failed but i was dying anyhow 
who was there to fear i shouldve torched his camp 
and fleet snuffed out father son and all 
their race then thrown myself onto the pyre 
o sun who lights the world with flame and juno 
witness to my pain enabler of our love 
and hecate howled to by night on city crossroads 
and vengeful furies gods of dying dido 
direct your might at his deserving treachery 
and hear my prayers if that cursed man must reach 
port and make it to the shore if the fates 
of jupiter demand it and this end is fixed 
let him suffer war with daring tribes banished 
from his land torn from ilus embrace 
let him beg for help and see the unjust deaths 
of friends and when hes yielded to an unfair peace 
dont let him enjoy his kingdom or sweet life 
let him die too young unburied on the sand 
i pour out this final prayer with my lifeblood 
tyrians you must torment his sons and all 
his future race make this offering to my ashes 
let there be no love or treaties between us 
rise up from my bones unknown avenger 
hunt the dardan colonists with flames and swords 
now or any times theres strength to strike 
my curse is this our lands our seas our swords will clash 
the trojans will fight wars for generations 
now didos thoughts went skidding here and there 
how soon could she end her hated life 
she spoke briefly to barce sychaeus nurse 
since her own was black ash in her former land 
nurse dear fetch my sister anna tell her 
to sprinkle herself with spring water and quickly 
bring beasts and offerings for sacrifice 
thats her task you put on a holy headband 
my plans to complete the rituals i started 
for the stygian god and end my grief 
by setting fire to the hateful trojans pyre 
the nurse dashed off with creaky zeal but dido 
wild and trembling at her awful plan 
her bloodshot eyes darting around her cheeks 
ashen and splotchy at her coming death 
burst into the inner court and climbed the pyre 
beside herself she unsheathed the dardans sword 
a gift not meant for such a use when she 
saw the trojan clothes and wellknown bed 
she lingered for a bit with thoughts and tears 
then lay down and spoke her final words 
sweet remnants of lovesweet while god and fate 
allowedtake this soul free me from this grief 
im done with life ive run the course fate gave me 
now my noble ghost goes to the underworld 
i built a shining city gazed upon its walls 
avenged my husband on my evil brother 
happy all too happy if only trojan keels 
had never touched my shores she buried her face 
in the bed and cried ill die though unavenged 
i choose to join the shades like this let the cruel 
trojans eyes drink in this fire from the sea 
and take with him the evil omen of my death 
as she spoke her servants saw her falling 
on the sword the blade bubbled with blood 
and stained her hands a cry went up in the high hall 
rumors reeled around the shaken city 
houses groaned with grief and womens wails 
and the sky echoed the clamor as if carthage 
or ancient tyre were falling and the enemy 
were in the cityraging fires rolling through 
the homes of men and temples of the gods 
her sister heard the noise and ran half dead with fear 
she cut through the crowd raking her face with nails 
pummeling her breast and cried to dying dido 
this was your plan my sister you wanted to trick me 
the pyre the flames and altar were for this 
you left me with so much to grieve for did you 
scorn my company id have shared your fate 
one pain one sword one instant should have taken us 
did i build the pyre and call upon our gods 
just to be absent heartlessly as you lay here 
youve destroyed us both sister and our people 
and the elders and your city let me wash 
your wounds with water let me touch my lips 
to your last breath she climbed the steps and held 
her dying sister stroking her and sobbing 
staunching the dark blood with her own dress 
dido tried to lift her heavy eyes again 
she couldnt the deep wound hissed inside her chest 
three times she tried to rise leaning on her elbow 
three times she fell back on the bed with dimming eyes 
she sought the light of sky found it and groaned 
then almighty juno pitying her long 
and painful death sent iris from olympus 
to free the trapped soul from its mortal bonds 
because her death poor thing was not deserved 
or fated but premature and in the heat of passion 
proserpina hadnt plucked one of her golden 
hairs yet nor condemned her soul to stygian orcus 
so dewy iris flew down on her saffron wings 
trailing a thousand colors through the sunlight 
she stopped over her head i take this offering 
down to dis as told and free you from your body 
she cut a strand of hair at once all warmth 
slipped away didos life ebbed to the winds 
book 
aeneas and his crew sailed out to sea 
resolute he cut through waters dark with wind 
gazing back at city walls lit up by flames 
poor didos pyre no one knew what caused the blaze 
but they knew the great grief of a love betrayed 
and what a womans passion could unleash 
their hearts were somber with foreboding 
when deep sea held the ships and no land could 
be seenjust sky and sea on every side 
dark rainclouds settled overhead bringing night 
and storm the waves bristled with shadow 
the pilot palinurus cried from his high stern 
why so many cloudbanks closing on the sky 
what awaits us father neptune he told the crew 
to trim the sails and bend to the strong oars 
bearing down out of the wind and said brave 
aeneas not even if jupiter would promise 
could i hope for italy under these skies 
the winds have changed and roar across our path 
from the dark west the air thickens to mist 
we cant resist or hold our course fortune 
has defeated us lets follow where she calls 
the friendly shores and harbor of sicilian eryx 
are close if i remember rightly and can trace 
our journey back by the same stars i charted here 
pious aeneas replied thats what these winds call for 
ive watched you struggle vainly for some time 
change your route no country has a greater 
call on me theres no place id rather dock 
our tired ships more than acestes homeland 
whose soil cradles the bones of my father 
they made for port the west winds now welcome 
filled the sails the ships rode swiftly on the swells 
at last with joy they landed on familiar shores 
from a far hill acestes marveled at their coming 
and went to meet the allied shipsa rough sight 
with his spears and libyan shebears pelt 
crinisus a rivergod had sired him on 
a trojan mother mindful of his parents 
he rejoiced at their return glad to help 
the weary men with pleasing rustic riches 
when easts bright dawn had driven out the stars 
aeneas called the sailors to him from across 
the shore standing on a knoll to speak 
great dardans noble race of divine blood 
a year has passed the months have turned full circle 
since we put my godlike fathers bones in earth 
and offered sacrifice on his sad altars unless 
im wrong that day is here ill always count it bitter 
but ill always honor it as the gods wished 
on this daywhether i roamed the libyan shoals 
in exile or were caught at sea or prisoned 
in mycenaeid observe my vow to offer 
annual rites and heap the altar with due gifts 
we stand before my fathers very bones and ash 
it was the will and power of the gods i think 
that let us travel to a friendly port so come 
lets conduct this ceremony gladly 
well ask for winds and when our citys built 
i hope to honor him in his own temple yearly 
trojanborn acestes offers you two bulls 
for every ship summon our native gods 
to feast and those our host worships as well 
if the ninth days dawn brings gentle weather 
and the suns rays light our mortal earth 
ill hold trojan contestsfirst for the quick ships 
then the fastest runner then for someone strong 
and skilled with spears or flying arrows or 
brave at landing blows with rawhide boxinggloves 
all of you come try to win a palm as prize 
and now hush wreathe your heads with leaves 
aeneas bound his brow with venus myrtle 
so did old acestes helymus and young 
ascanius the others followed suit then he 
left the gathering going to the grave mound 
many thousands crowding all around him 
now he duly poured onto the soil two bowls 
each of unmixed wine fresh milk and holy blood 
he scattered purple flowers and prayed sacred 
father once again i greet your ashes shade 
and spirit you whom i saved from troybut why 
since i was not allowed to look for italy 
with you or those fated fields or the unknown 
tiber at his words a glistening snake slid out 
from the tombs base drawing seven giant coils 
it calmly circled round the mound and altars 
its back was mottled with blue spots its scales 
gleamed bright with goldlike clouds behind a rainbow 
colored by the suns rays with a thousand hues 
aeneas was stupefied to see it the snakes 
long body glided through the polished cups 
and bowls it tried the feast and harmlessly 
went back inside the tomb leaving the altars 
aeneas renewed his fathers rites with still more zeal 
uncertain if the serpent was the places spirit 
or anchises he duly killed two sheep two sows 
two heifers with black hides and poured the wine 
from bowls calling on the soul of great 
anchises the shade he wished to come from acheron 
his men gladly offered gifts from what they had 
they heaped the altars high and killed the bulls 
others spread out through the grass lined up 
cauldrons or roasted spitted meat on coals 
the day theyd waited for arrived phathons horses 
brought the ninth dawn and a cloudless sky 
acestes fame his noble name had roused 
the local people they thronged along the shore 
glad to see aeneas menand to compete 
first trophies were put out for all to see 
sacred tripods palms and leafy crowns 
prizes for the winners as well as weapons 
robes dyed purple gold and silver bars 
the bugle rang out from a mound the games were on 
four matching ships with heavy oars were chosen 
from the fleet to enter the first race 
mnestheus led the krakens eager crewhed be 
italys mnestheus of the memmi clan 
gyas led the giant ship chimaera its bulk 
huge as a city a dardan crew propelled its 
triple rows of oars and triple decks 
sergestus founder of the sergian clan captained 
the massive centaur on the seagreen scylla 
rode cloanthusyour ancestor cluentius 
far out to sea a boulder faced the foaming shore 
at times when swollen waters pounded it and 
winter winds concealed the stars it was submerged 
in calmer skies its level crown rose peacefully 
above the sea a pleasant stop for sunning gulls 
here aeneas propped a leafy oakbranch a living 
marker it was the sailors sign to turn around 
and circle back on their long course starting spots 
were set by lot far off on the sterns 
the captains stood out in their gold and purple 
the crews were crowned with poplar leaves their bare backs 
glistened rubbed with oil they took up seats 
along the benches arms taut on the oars and waited intent 
on the signal their hearts pounded fiercely 
tense and desperate with desire for glory 
when the piercing bugle sang the ships sprang 
forward from their berths the sailors cries struck 
the high skies taut arms strained to churn the sea 
plowing paths in parallel tearing furrows 
in the sea with oars and threepronged beaks 
not even speeding chariots springing 
from their stalls devour racetracks with such speed 
when the drivers strike their team with rippling reins 
and lean forward to snap the horses with the lash 
all the grove was roaring with the shouts 
and cheers of fans the sheltered shores echoed their cries 
the din pounded the hills and set them ringing 
as the crowd erupted gyas left the rest behind 
and took the lead cloanthus was in second place 
his crew was better but his boat was sluggish 
from its weight behind them neck to neck 
centaur vied with kraken trying to seize the lead 
first kraken then huge centaur ran ahead 
then both raced together prows aligned 
they split the salt sea with long keels as they 
neared the reefs closing on the turningpost 
gyas leading at the midpoint of the race 
rebuked his pilot menoetes why so far 
to starboard steer this way hug the reef 
have the port oars graze it let the other boats stay 
farther out but menoetes feared the lurking 
rocks and pulled the prow back out to sea 
gyas cried again youre off the course 
steer for the rocksand now he saw cloanthus 
on his tail steering a tighter tack cutting 
to the left between the roaring rocks and 
gyas shipand he glided to the front 
getting to safe water leaving the post behind 
that was the last straw gyas flared up in 
a fury tears wetting his cheeks forgetting 
dignity and the safety of his crew he shoved 
slow menoetes from the stern into the sea 
and took the rudder himself urging on his team 
turning the tiller shoreward when menoetes 
heavy surfaced from the depths at last 
an old man dripping in drenched clothes he struggled 
to the level rock and sat on its dry crown 
as he fell as he swam the trojans laughed 
they laughed to see him vomit floods of sea 
sergestus and mnestheus in last place 
rejoiced at the chance to overtake slow gyas 
near the rocks sergestus took the lead 
he was ahead but not yet by a boatlength 
his rival krakens prow was closing on him 
mnestheus strode midships among his oarsmen 
urging them nows the time to bend to oars 
men of hector whom i picked as comrades 
in troys final hour use the strength and spirit 
you had in libyas shallows the ionian sea 
and the greedy waves of cape malea 
i dont aim for victory and first place now 
and yetbut only you pick victors neptune 
but being last means disgrace fight it men 
avoid this ignominy all bent to oars 
in fierce rivalry the bronze stern shuddered 
with great strokes and the sea flew by gasps shook 
their bodies and dry mouths their sweat ran in streams 
and now chance brought the glory they desired 
sergestus succumbed to lunacy and drove 
his boat still closer to the rocks and into danger 
unhappy manhis boat rammed onto jutting reefs 
the rocks shook and the oars snapped on sharp edges 
the damaged prow was wedged in place with a shout 
the crew leapt up to deal with the delay 
and pulled the shattered oars in from the sea 
with ironplated poles and sharptipped hooks 
mnestheus good luck here made him even keener 
a swift pull of oars with the winds he prayed for 
put him near the shore as he returned 
like a dove abruptly startled from her nest 
where she and her sweet chicks hide in the rocks 
flushed out she darts in fear to the fields 
beating her wings loudly but soon she glides 
along the steady air and skims a skyblue path 
so mnestheus kraken heading homeward 
cut the waves gliding after her first spurt 
he left sergestus struggling in the spiky reefs 
and shallows calling out for help in vain 
learning how to race with broken oars 
next mnestheus chased chimaeras giant bulk 
the boat had no pilot and gyas fell behind 
now only cloanthus led already near 
the goal mnestheus made a massive effort 
at this the shouting doubled they all cheered 
the ship in second place the sky echoed the din 
one crew would hate to lose the glory of an honor 
all but won theyd trade their lives for victory 
the others were encouraged by success belief in 
victory spurred them on and perhaps theyd have 
pulled ahead and won but cloanthus stretched 
both hands to the waves and poured out prayers 
rulers of the sea whose waters i now sail 
on shore ill gladly kill a white bull at your altars 
ill pay this vow then throw the entrails in your 
briny waves and pour you unmixed wine 
beneath the sea phorcus choir the nereds 
and the virgin panopea heard him 
father portunus himself propelled the boat 
ahead quicker than south winds or flying arrows 
the vessel sped to land and settled in the harbor 
then anchises son summoning them all 
had the herald loudly proclaim cloanthus 
as the victor and veiled his brow with living laurel 
the crews picked prizes for their ships for each 
wine three bulls and a large silver ingot 
special gifts went to the captains for the winner 
a goldstitched cloak richly worked along the edge 
with meliboean purple in a double wave 
a boy was woven on it the prince of leafy ida 
chasing swift stags with his spearyou could almost 
hear him gasp an eagle bearer of joves bolt 
plummeted to grab him with hooked claws 
the aged guardians vainly raised their hands 
to heaven and dogs barked madly at the sky 
the man in second place received a breastplate 
made of golden chain mail three layers thick 
which aeneas himself had ripped from demoleos 
when he beat him near high troys simos both 
a thing of beauty and protection in a battle 
his slaves phegeus and sagaris could barely 
hold it on their shoulders but when demoleos 
wore it he chased straggling trojans at a run 
third place was a matched pair of bronze cauldrons 
and cups of silver that were rough with carved reliefs 
as they were proudly leaving with their prizes 
all with purple ribbons round their temples 
sergestus who for all his skill had barely wrenched 
his ship off the sharp reefs now pulled into harbor 
mocked pride lost oars gone one tier disabled 
just like a snake a bronze wheel crushes on the road 
or one smashed by a travelers cruel stone 
mangled and halfdead its desperate 
to glide away but cant it keeps coiling 
its long body fiercely rearing up its neck 
hissing eyes like fire but the maimed part drags it 
down and the snake weaves knots and falls back 
on itselfso the ship limped under oars 
still it spread full sails and reached the port 
aeneas gave sergestus the gift hed pledged happy 
that the ship was safe the crew on land 
the prize was a cretan slave girl handy in 
minervas work pholo she nursed twin sons 
the contest over pious aeneas headed 
to a grassy field hemmed in by woods 
and curving hills the middle of this valley 
formed a natural racetrack the hero arrived 
many thousands with him and sat on a raised seat 
he offered gifts to lure any brave souls 
eager to compete in running and displayed 
the prizes trojans and sicilians gathered 
from all sides first nisus and euryalus 
the latter marked by beauty and green youth 
nisus by his pious love for him next 
prince diores of priams royal line 
then salius and patron the first acarnian 
the other a tegean of arcadian blood 
next were two sicilians the woodsmen helymus 
and panopes followers of old acestes 
and many others lost since to tradition 
among them all aeneas said listen to 
my words youll be glad to hear them not one 
of you will leave without a prize from me 
each man will get two cretan arrows bright 
with polished iron and a doubleheaded ax 
embossed in silver same for all the first three 
will get extra gifts and olive wreaths to wear 
first place wins a horse with gorgeous trappings 
second place an amazonian quiver 
full of thracian arrows with a broad gold strap 
tied with a shining gemstone clasp the man 
whos third will leave happy with this argive helmet 
they took their spots at the signal suddenly 
they sprang out from the gates and sped over 
the distance rushing on like stormclouds when they 
saw the finish line nisus flashed into 
first place faster than winged lightning and 
the wind next but next by a long interval 
came salius further back euryalus 
was third helymus right behind him diores 
was on helymuss heels in turn 
looming at his shoulderand if the track 
were longer hed have edged in front of him 
or left in doubt who won third place and now 
almost at the very end they were closing 
on the goal exhausted when unlucky 
nisus skidded in a pool of slippery blood 
where bulls slaughtered for a sacrifice 
had soaked the ground and lush green grass with gore 
he was already relishing his victory 
when he fell going down facefirst 
he lay there in the filthy dung and sacred gore 
even so he remembered his love for 
euryalus rising from the slime he tripped 
salius who went tumbling to the earth 
to applause and friendly cheers euryalus 
raced on to the triumph nisus had granted 
next was helymus diores took third 
but salius deafened the giant stadium 
and the elders in front with loud cries his prize 
was stolen from him by a trick euryalus 
popularity and graceful tears protected 
himand his purity so lovely in a 
lovely boy diores loudly backed him up 
hed lose third prize if salius won first 
father aeneas said your gifts are safely yours 
no one will change the list of winners but i 
can pity the misfortune of my blameless friend 
he gave salius the huge pelt of a libyan 
lion a load of shaggy fur and gilded claws 
then nisus said if the losers get such prizes 
because you pity stumblers what gift do i deserve 
id have won the crown of victory 
if not for the same bad luck that salius had 
he showed his face and body slimed with filthy dung 
aeneas best of leaders laughed and had 
a shield fetched didymans work torn 
by trojans from the temple door of neptune 
he gave the fine young man this gorgeous gift 
the race was over and the gifts distributed 
now he said if theres a man of ready heart 
and courage come wrap your hands in hide put up 
your fists he set out double prizes for the boxing 
a bull with gilded horns and garlands for the victor 
a sword and handsome helmet to console the loser 
at once the strongman dares lifted up his head 
and stood a murmur rippled through the crowd 
he was the only one whod boxed with paris 
hed knocked out the champion butes a giant 
who claimed his lineage from bebrycian 
amycus and laid him dying on the yellow 
sand near the mound that held great hector 
such was the towering man who stood to fight 
he showed his muscled shoulders stretching out 
his arms in turn throwing punches in the air 
he needed a rival but who from that huge crowd 
would dare to face the man and bind their hands with leather 
thinking everyone had yielded him the prize 
dares stepped up at once to where aeneas sat 
grabbed the prize bull by the horn and said 
goddessborn if no one dares to fight with me 
how long must i stand i shouldnt have to wait 
let me take the prize all the trojans roared 
in favor he should be given what was promised 
but acestes raked entellus with harsh words 
as they sat together on their grassy bench 
entellus whats the point of your great past 
if you meekly let this great prize go without 
a fight what happened to your idol the trainer 
eryx was he famous for no reason what of 
your glory throughout sicily the prizes hanging 
in your house he answered fear hasnt dulled 
my love of glory but my blood is sluggish 
with the slowness of old age my strength is gone 
if i were in my youth the same age that scoundrel 
trusts in as he preens if i were like that 
it wouldnt take a prize for me to fight or some 
fancy steer i dont care about the gifts 
he flung into the ring immensely heavy boxing 
gloves that fierce eryx had worn in his matches 
when hed bound his hands with the hard hide 
the crowd gasped at the huge gloves made of pelts 
from seven giant bulls stiff with lead and iron 
dares himself gaped the most and backed away 
greatsouled aeneas handled the gloves weight 
the great mass of twisted bands of leather 
the old boxer said with spirit imagine if 
youd seen the gloves of hercules himself 
the grim struggle on this very shore 
your brother eryx wore these gloves look 
theyre smeared with blood and splattered brains 
to face great hercules and i wore them 
while i still had strength and younger blood 
before old age sprinkled white hairs on my head 
but if my gloves scare trojan dares and 
pious aeneas and acestes are agreed 
lets fight on equal terms ill give up eryx 
gloves fear not and you take off your trojan ones 
he threw the lined cloak from his shoulders baring 
his huge frame his giant limbs and muscles 
and stood hulking in the center of the sand 
father aeneas brought out matching gloves 
and bound the hands of both with equal weight 
they stood on tiptoes holding their arms high up 
to the sky then they bobbed around 
keeping their heads out of range feinting 
with their hands sparring for an opening 
dares youth made him better on his feet 
entellus strength was in his arms and bulk 
but his stiff knees shook gasps racked his huge frame 
the men threw many useless punches but landed 
many too hitting hollow flanks thumping 
each others chests often their hands strayed 
to ears and heads their jaws rattled with the impact 
entellus solid and unmoving stayed in place 
dodging blows by watching carefully and twisting 
dares looked like he was laying siege and placing 
catapults around a mountain fort or town 
he tried this route and that probing everywhere 
with skill pressing him with varied jabsno luck 
entellus rose and raised his right arm high 
but dares saw the blow aimed from above 
and nimbly dodged it the man squandered his strength 
on the air and worse still himself heavy tumbled 
heavily his vast bulk landing on the ground 
like a pine hollowed with age and torn up by 
the roots on mount erymanthus or great ida 
excited trojans and sicilians leapt up 
their shouts rose to the sky acestes feeling pity 
quickly ran to lift his old friend from the ground 
but the hero wasnt slowed or scared by falling 
he came back fiercer his anger brought him strength 
shame kindled him and trust in his own skill 
he chased dares round the ring in fury landing 
endless blows with both his fists there was no pause 
no chance to rest he was like a hailstorm 
rattling roofsso dense were the punches that 
the hero rained on dares pounding him all over 
father aeneas didnt let this fury last 
entellus was berserk with bitter rage 
he stopped the match pulling out exhausted 
dares and soothed him with these words poor man 
have you lost your mind dont you see 
his strength is not his own but backed by gods 
give in to their power so the contest ended 
dares faithful friends hauled him to the ships 
his knees couldnt support him and his head flopped 
side to side he was vomiting thick clots 
of blood and teeth his helpers were called back 
to fetch the sword and helmet but the palm and bull 
were for entellus he was in high spirits 
puffed up by his prize goddessborn aeneas 
and you trojans see what strength i had 
when young see the death from which youve rescued 
dares then he stood before the bullock 
his prize for victory pulled back his right fist 
and slammed the heavy glove between its horns 
the skull caved in spilling out the brains 
and the bull collapsed to earth and twitched in death 
over it he poured these heartfelt words eryx 
i offer you this life for dares better so 
i won now ill retire my gloves and talent 
aeneas next invited anyone who wanted 
to compete in archery and named the prizes 
with great strength he lifted the mast from sergestus 
ship feeding a rope through the top 
he attached a fluttering dove their arrows goal 
the contestants came and threw their lots 
in a bronze helmet to loud cheers first place 
went to hippocon hyrtacus son next 
mnestheus whod placed in the ship race still wreathed 
with the olive leaves around his brow 
eurytion was thirdfamed pandarus brother 
who was told to break the treaty back at troy 
and aimed his bow into the mass of greeks 
last from the deep helmet came acestes name 
he too dared to try the task of younger men 
each man bent his pliant bow putting muscle 
into it pulling arrows from his quiver 
from the twanging bow of young hippocon 
the first vibrating shaft sliced through the air 
it flew straight to the wooden mast and stuck 
as the mast shuddered the dove fluttered 
in fear the whole place rang with loud applause 
next keen mnestheus stood and drew his bow 
he pointed high aiming both eye and arrow 
at the mark he didnt manage to impale 
the birdbad luckbut he broke the knotted rope 
around her foot that tied her to the mast 
the dove released flew southward to dark clouds 
eurytion had long since held his arrow taut 
and his bow drawn praying to his brother 
he peered for the dove as she beat her wings 
in joy in the empty sky rising to the night 
and shot her she fell lifeless leaving her soul 
in the stars returning the lodged arrow 
acestes was still there but the prize was gone 
he shot his arrow to the heavens anyhow 
to show his veteran skill and ringing bow 
and then a sudden miracle took place important 
in the futureas its fulfillment showed 
when stern prophets at last knew its meaning 
soaring through the empty sky the arrow 
blazed a flaming path then vanished in the breeze 
like a shooting star falling from the heavens 
that draws its shining trail across the sky 
the trojans and sicilians were amazed 
and called upon the gods great aeneas did not 
reject the omen he hugged happy acestes 
heaping him with lavish gifts and said 
take these father the great king of olympus 
shows by such signs youll win honors like no 
other this prize belonged to aged anchises 
a bowl embossed with figures thracian cisseus 
gave it him long ago a handsome gift 
a token of himself and a pledge of love 
he ringed acestes brows with living laurel 
and named him winner first among them all 
good eurytion readily gave up his place 
though he alone shot down the soaring bird 
the man who broke the rope was next in gifts 
last the one whose arrow was wedged in the mast 
before the contest ended aeneas summoned ilus 
friend and guardian epytides and told 
those loyal ears go and tell ascanius 
if his boy troops are prepared and their horses 
marshaled in straight rows to lead them in 
and show himself in armor in honor of his 
grandfather he told the crowd packed in the lengthy 
circuit to clear out leaving the fields empty 
the boys advanced before their parents eyes 
shining on their bridled horses trojans and 
sicilians roared in admiration as they passed 
their hair was bound with cropped wreaths in the old way 
each held double irontipped cornel lances 
some slung polished quivers on their back 
soft coils of twisted gold sat on their collarbones 
three squadrons with three captains galloped in 
twelve boys were in each group the separate ranks 
gleamed brightly following their leaders one glad 
troop of boys was led by little priam 
his grandfathers namesakepolitus child future 
father of italians he rode a thracian horse 
a tall prancing piebald with white brow and 
pasterns next came atys the latin atii 
trace their clan and ancestry to him 
little atys a boy loved by the boy ilus 
last and handsome past the rest ilus 
steered a sidonian horse that lovely dido 
gave him to remember her a pledge of love 
the others rode on old acestes native 
steeds the dardans watching clapped to see 
the anxious boys feeling joy at the sight 
young faces that recalled passed generations 
happy on their horses the boys circled the field 
before their parents eyes from a distance 
epytides yelled and cracked his whip the sign 
each troop split in equal halves who rode apart 
at the call they wheeled back to meet again 
and charged with spearsa military tactic 
one side wove a pattern the other mirrored it 
they formed intersecting circles riding left 
and right their play looked like armed battle 
at times they risked their backs in flight at times attacked 
with swords at times rode in peaceful pairings 
just so the labyrinth in high crete they say 
was woven of blind walls its paths an enigma 
of a thousand forking ways that foiled all clues 
each slip uncaught and irrevocable 
the sons of troy tangled their horses paths 
weaving battles and retreats in play 
like dolphins cutting libyan and carpathian waters 
as they skim the seas and breach the waves 
ascanius renewed this custom and this contest 
for his horsemen when he circled alba longa 
with her walls he taught the native latins 
to observe it as he did with the young trojans 
the albans taught their own children great rome 
inherited and kept the ancient ritual 
the boys now stand for troy the troops are trojan 
these were the games observed in honor of anchises 
and now fortune changed and showed her perfidy 
as they performed games for the annual rites juno 
hurried iris earthward to the trojan fleet 
backing her with wind scheming not yet 
satiated in her ancient grudge 
iris flew along the rainbows thousand hues 
her quick descent was seen by none she sighted 
the giant gathering and on the shore 
the deserted harbor the abandoned fleet 
on the empty beach the trojan women 
wept for lost anchises looking at the ocean 
through their tears they deplored the many reefs 
and voyages that faced their weary people still 
sick of sea and hardship they longed to settle 
iris mixed among them no novice in the art 
of harm she shed her goddesss clothes and face 
and became bero doryclus old wife 
whod once had a family and famous sons 
she pushed through the trojan women saying 
unlucky us that greek hands didnt haul us off 
to die in war beneath our countrys walls 
unhappy race what does fortune have in store 
this is the seventh summer since troys fall and still 
we bear this journey through the lands and seas 
the hostile reefs and skies chasing receding 
italy through endless seas were on land 
owned by our kinsman eryx and our host acestes 
wholl stop us from laying walls for our own town 
o fatherland and gods saved from the greeks in vain 
will no city be called troy will we never 
see simos and xanthus hectors rivers 
come help me set these cursed ships on fire 
in my sleep i saw the prophetess cassandra 
handing me lit torches seek troy here she said 
this is your home nows the time for action 
such omens call for no delay i see right here 
four altars raised to neptune hell give us fireand daring 
she was the first to seize a deadly torch 
with effort she held it high swung it and threw 
the women were shocked and stupefied 
now the oldest woman in the crowd 
pyrgo royal nurse to many sons of priam 
said women this is not doryclus wife 
bero note the signs of divine beauty 
her burning eyes her bravery look at 
her face how she sounds and how she walks 
i myself just left bero she was sick 
and sad that she alone would miss the rites 
and could not pay anchises his due honors 
at first the women were divided they stared 
at the ships with angry looks torn between 
fierce longing for their present spot 
and the lands to which fate called iris rose up 
through the sky on level wings and as she left 
she drew a massive rainbow in the clouds 
now they shouted louder maddened by 
the omen some snatched fire from nearby hearths 
others robbed the altars they hurled branches leaves 
and burning torches at the ships fire raged 
amok over the seats and oars and painted sterns 
eumelus brought the message to the gathering 
around anchises tomb the ships were burning 
looking back they saw a rising billow of black ash 
ascanius just now happily leading 
his troops galloped fiercely to the chaos 
at the ships his breathless guardians couldnt catch him 
whats this new madness my poor citizens he cried 
what are you doing its not hostile camps of greeks 
you set on fire its hope itself look im your 
ascanius he threw his helmet at his feet 
the one he wore to play at battle aeneas 
and a band of trojans rushed up too 
but the women scattered fearfully along 
the shore to hide in any rocky nook or wood 
they shunned daylight and their deed sane again 
juno driven from their hearts they knew the men 
but this didnt stop the flames or sap their wild 
strength beneath the sodden wood the pitch 
was live spewing smoke and smoldering 
eating at the hulls wrecking the ships frames 
heroic strength and streams of water were no use 
pious aeneas tore his clothing from his chest 
stretched out his hands and begged the gods for help 
almighty jupiter if you dont hate the trojans 
one and all if your former piety 
still cares for human suffering let our ships 
survive save our fragile hopes from death 
or if we merit it kill whats left of us 
with your deadly bolt drown us by your hand 
hed hardly finished when a dark storm broke out 
with a violent downpour the fields and steep hills 
shook with thunder dark rain poured in sheets 
across the sky driven by the strong south wind 
the ships filled up with water it soaked their halfburned 
timbers until all the smoke and flames were out 
the hulls except for four were saved from ruin 
aeneas was shattered by this bitter loss 
his grave concerns pulled him this way and that 
should they forget their destiny and stay 
in sicily or aim for the italian coast 
then old nautes athenas only student 
whod been famous for his foresight the goddess 
always told him what the gods great rage 
would bring and what the chain of fate required 
this nautes comforted aeneas goddessborn 
lets follow where fate draws us even if we backtrack 
come what may well win out by endurance 
dardanian acestes comes from divine stock 
entrust this willing partner with your plans 
and set him over those whove lost their ships 
or are sick of your great project and your fate 
pick old men and women wearied by the sea 
all the weak all who fear the risks 
and let these tired people have their city here 
if you permit theyll call the place acesta 
his old friends advice disturbed aeneas 
and now his worries tore at him still more 
as black night in her chariot drove across 
the heavens suddenly the image of anchises 
his father came to him descending from the skies 
son dearer than my life while i had life 
so troubled by troys fate i visit you 
at jupiters command he drove the fire 
from your ships at last showing pity 
follow the fine counsel that old nautes gives 
take only chosen men the bravest hearts 
to italy in latium therell be a harsh 
and rustic race for you to crush but first 
come to diss hellish home ill be by deep 
avernus impious tartaruss sullen shades 
dont keep me elysiums my home and the lovely 
gatherings of the good chaste sibyl will bring you 
once youve offered pools of blood from blackskinned sheep 
youll learn about your people and your city 
now goodbye damp night wheels in her midcourse 
i can feel the breath of cruel dawns horses 
he dissolved like smoke into thin air 
aeneas cried now where are you rushing 
and from whom who stops us from embracing 
then he woke the sleeping fires embers 
and humbly worshiped trojan lar and whitehaired 
vestas shrine with sacred grain and incense 
next aeneas called his friends acestes first 
to tell them jupiters command his dear 
fathers guidance and what he had decided 
their debate was short acestes said yes 
they formed a colony of women and the willing 
people with no need for boundless glory 
the rest repaired the rowers benches and the timbers 
eaten by the fire adding new oars and ropes 
they were few but spirited in war 
aeneas sketched out city limits with a plow 
assigning homes he called the districts ilium 
and troy trojan acestes loved his kingdom 
he formed a court and gave laws to new senators 
on eryx summit near the stars they built a shrine 
to venus of idalia a priest and sacred 
grove were granted to anchises tomb 
now nine days of feasting passed the altars 
had been honored and calm winds smoothed the seas 
the south wind called them to the deep again 
a gale of lament went up along the curving 
shore they embraced delayed a day and night 
the very men and mothers whod found the sea 
too harsh the gods power unbearable 
now wanted to endure the pain of exile 
in tears himself good aeneas offered comfort 
with kind words and left them with acestes 
he ordered three calves killed for eryx a lamb 
for the storms then he had the mooring loosened 
he stood high on the prow holding a bowl 
his head ringed with olive leaves and poured 
clear wine and entrails on the briny sea 
eagerly the sailors swept the sea with oars 
as they sailed a fair wind rose behind them 
but meanwhile venus distraught went to speak 
to neptune she poured out passionate complaints 
neptune junos fierce rage and stubborn heart 
force me to stoop to every kind of plea 
times passage doesnt soften her nor piety 
shes unbowed by jupiters commands and fate 
her malice has devoured a phrygian city 
dragged the scraps of troy through every torture 
but thats not enoughshe persecutes dead bones 
and ashes her rage makes sense to her alone 
you saw yourself the trouble she caused recently 
on the libyan waves mingling sea and sky 
unwisely betting on aeolus storms 
she dared this in your realm she even set 
the trojan women on a path of crime 
they burned the ships sank the fleet and forced 
the men to leave their friends on unknown shores 
i beg of you let the rest sail safely 
let them reach laurentian tiberif this is right 
if the goddesses of fate give them this city 
then saturns son tamer of the deep seas said 
youve every right to trust my kingdom venus 
you were born in it and ive earned this trust 
ive often stopped the sky and seas great frenzy 
on land no less i helped aeneas simos 
and xanthus can attest to it when achilles 
pinned the panicked trojans to the walls 
sending thousands to their deaths stopping up 
the groaning streams so xanthus couldnt reach 
the sea i rescued aeneas in a cloud 
as he fought brave achilles a greater man 
in strength and dearer to the gods even though 
i wanted to uproot troys lying wallsthe walls 
i built i havent changed my mind let go your fear 
hell reach avernus harbor safely as you wish 
therell only be one man to mourn for lost at sea 
one life will pay for many so neptune soothed 
and cheered the goddesss heart then he yoked 
his wild horses with their golden harness 
damp with foam and fed out rein he sped across 
the oceans surface in his seablue chariot 
under the thundering axles waves sank down 
swells subsided and the clouds dissolved 
up came his manyshaped companions giant whales 
glaucus old troop palaemon inos son 
speedy tritons all of phorcus army thetis 
panopea and melite at his left 
thalia nesaea cymodoce spio 
at this a calm joy lulled aeneas anxious mind 
he ordered that the masts be raised at once 
and the sails be stretched out on the yardarms 
as one the crew hauled on the ropes letting out 
the canvas to the left and right as one 
they turned the high yards fair winds moved the fleet 
palinurus in the front led the dense 
armada the rest were told to tack his course 
damp night was near the midpoint of the sky 
and the sailors sprawling by their oars 
on rigid benches were resting peacefully 
when sleep gliding from the stars above 
breached the dark and chased away the shadows 
looking for you palinurus bringing fatal 
slumber to a guiltless man in phorbas shape 
the god sat on the ships high stern and made his pitch 
palinurus isus son the seas themselves 
propel us the winds blow evenlytheres time to rest 
lay down your head steal your tired eyes from work 
ill take on your duties for a while 
palinurus barely glanced at him you ask 
me of all men to trust the seas calm face 
and quiet waves to have faith in this monster 
as if id leave aeneas to the lying breezes 
the clear skies treachery has fooled me many times 
he held the tiller tight not letting go 
and fixed his eyes upon the stars above 
then the god shook over him a branch that dripped 
with lethes dew and drugs of stygian strength 
it shut his swimming eyes against his will 
hed hardly slumped in unexpected rest 
when sleep bent over him and pitched him in the sea 
as he fell he ripped the rudder from the stern 
calling often on his friends but unheard 
sleep rose on his wings into the sheer air 
and the fleet sailed on as safely as before 
unperturbed as father neptune had assured 
as aeneas ship approached the sirens crags 
once treacherous and white with many bones 
where boulders battered by the surf roared endlessly 
he realized he was drifting with no pilot groaning 
deeply he himself took up the helm across 
the midnight sea sick at heart for his friends fate 
ah palinurus rashly trusting in calm winds 
and sky youll lie unburied on an unknown shore 
book 
so he said in tears and gave the fleet free rein 
at last they glided into cumaes bay 
and turned the prows to face the sea the anchors 
bite secured the ships the shore was fringed 
with curving keels young men sprang out eagerly 
onto the sand of italy some tried to strike out 
sparks from flints deep veins others scoured the forest 
home to many beasts or noted streams theyd found 
pious aeneas made for great apollos temple 
and the vast cave nearby the sanctuary 
of dread sibyl into whom the delian seer 
breathes his mind and mission unveiling the future 
they neared the goldroofed temple in dianas grove 
its said that daedalus fleeing minos kingdom 
trusted himself to the sky on sweeping wings 
taking this unusual passage to the frosty 
north at last he floated down on chalcis peak 
back on land he pledged phoebus his wings 
his oars for flightand built a lofty shrine 
on its doors he carved androgeos death 
and the athenians who paid an awful price 
seven sons each year an urn holds the lots 
facing this the land of crete soars from the sea 
heres pasiphaes ruinous passion for a bull 
their stealthy coupling and their son the hybrid 
minotaur a monument to awful lust 
heres his lair the labyrinth of no return 
but its builder daedalus took pity on 
a princess love and solved the tangled turns 
guiding theseus blind footsteps with a thread 
icarus youd be here too if grief allowed 
twice your father tried to carve your fall in gold 
twice his hands fell from his work aeneas wanted 
to scan every detail but achates sent 
ahead returned with glaucus child deiphobe 
priestess of diana and apollo she said 
this is no time to be gaping at the sights 
kill seven bulls whove never felt the yoke 
and just as many sheep his men were quick 
to carry out the sacred task then the priestess 
called the trojans into her high temple 
theres a cliff at cumae whose vast flank is cut 
into a cave with openings to a hundred shafts 
through them rush the sibyls answers hundredfold 
as they reached the cave she cried we must consult 
the oracle at once look the god is present 
at the door her complexion changed her hair 
sprang loose she began to pant her heart was full 
of frenzy she seemed taller and her voice 
was not a humans for apollo was approaching 
and she felt his breath trojan aeneas she cried 
you hesitate to offer vows yet only then 
will the mighty jaws that shake this cavern open 
wide and awe us silence a chill shiver swept 
the trojans hardy bones their king prayed from his heart 
phoebus you who always pitied troys great pain 
who directed paris arrow to pierce achilles 
youve led my voyage through the many seas 
that flow around the continentsto far 
massilian tribes to fields that fringe the syrtes 
at last weve come to italys receding shores 
dont let iliums fate still hound us all you gods 
and goddesses if troy and her great fame were once 
an aggravation now with justice you may 
spare the race of pergamum holy priestess 
you who see the future let the trojans live 
in latium i only claim land owed to me 
by fate with their straying stormtossed gods 
ill raise a shrine of solid marble to phoebus 
and diana and choose feast days for apollo 
once i rule ill build a great shrine for you too 
kind sibyl ill include the secret prophecies 
you told my people and consecrate your priests 
but dont entrust your oracles to leaves or theyll 
end up muddled playthings spun by whirling 
breezes chant them yourself i beg he stopped 
the sibyl still could not accept apollo 
she spiraled through the cave trying to force 
the great god from her mind but he wore her out 
still more and forced the seer to his will 
on their own the hundred huge shafts of the cave 
swung open wafting out her answers trojans 
youve left behind the seas great risks at last 
but graver ones remain on land the dardans 
will attain lavinian land let go this worry 
but theyll wish they hadnt i see brutal wars 
and bloody torrents frothing in the tiber 
there too youll find a simos a xanthus and 
greek camps in latium youll find a new achilles 
he too a goddesss son and worse theres juno 
everywhere a poor supplicant how many 
towns and tribes of italy youll beg for help 
the cause of so much trouble for the trojans 
again a foreign bride a foreign wedding 
dont give up at these misfortunes be as brave 
as fortune lets you the first path to safety 
will surprise you itll appear in a greek city 
the sibyl sang these fearsome riddles 
in her shrine wrapping truth in darkness 
as her cave echoed round her as apollo 
flicked her reins and sank his spurs in deeper 
when her seizure ended and her ravings stopped 
the hero aeneas spoke no aspect of these 
labors is unknown to me ive foreseen 
them all and thought about each one of them i ask 
one thing its said this spots a doorway to hells 
ruler and the murky swamp of acheron 
let me see my dear father face to face 
teach me how open the sacred portal 
he was the one my shoulders saved from flames 
and a thousand hostile spears all around us 
he shared my journey at my side he took on 
all the oceans all the threats of sky and sea 
a feeble man bearing a fate beyond old age 
he even begged me to approach your doors 
and seek you as a supplicant i pray 
be kind pity a father and his son you can 
hecate granted you avernus groves to rule 
if orpheus could summon his wifes shade 
with his thracian lyres melody 
if pollux shared his brothers death and often 
took his place in helland what of theseus 
and hercules my blood too is that of jove 
he grasped the altar praying and the sibyl spoke 
anchises trojan son born of divine blood 
its easy to descend into avernus 
night and day the door of dusky dis lies open 
to trace your steps and see the light again 
heres the toil and effort a few justly loved 
by jove whom blazing courage carried to the sky 
succeededsons of gods forest fills the center 
the dark embrace of cocytus surrounds it 
but if this urge compels you if you must indulge 
this folly twice crossing the stygian swamp 
twice seeing black tartarus hear then 
your first task a golden branch with golden 
leaves and stubborn golden stems hides in the murky 
foliage of proserpinas sacred tree 
concealed by forest and the valleys gloom none 
may penetrate the hidden alcoves under earth 
until theyve plucked its golden growth lovely 
proserpina ruled that it must be a gift 
for her if one branch is plucked a new one 
takes its place and grows gold leaves as well 
scour the deep woods once youve spotted it 
pluck it off by hand if youre the one fate calls 
itll break off easily if not no force 
no blade will help you tear it off also 
i have sad news a friends corpse lies along 
the shore and pollutes the fleet with death 
while you seek advice and loiter at my door 
first take him to his restingplace and bury him 
then offer black cattlethe first expiation 
this way youll see the stygian groves at last 
the lands barred to the living her mouth snapped shut 
aeneas left the cave walked on he stared 
sadly at the ground as he considered 
this blind turn of events loyal achates 
kept him company and shared his worries 
they covered many topics as they talked 
what friend did the sibyl mean what body 
needed burial and then they saw misenus 
on the sandy shore his life cut short unfairly 
aeolus son misenus most skilled of men 
to fire up hearts for battle with his bugles blare 
marked out by his spear and trumpet he used 
to fight next to his friend great hector when 
victorious achilles robbed hector of life 
this bravest of heroes joined aeneas 
as companion following no lesser leader 
but when he seized his hollow horn to make the seas 
resound challenging the gods in song the fool 
jealous triton grabbed him up if the tale 
is true and drowned him in the rocky surf 
they all raised loud laments around the body 
pious aeneas the most then carried out 
the sibyls orders in tears they heaped logs on 
the pyre and strove to raise it to the sky 
they entered ancient woods and wild lairs 
pine trees fell holmoaks rang to axes strikes 
oaks and ash trees fissured as the axmen drove in 
wedges they rolled huge rowans down the hills 
aeneas led the work and spurred the men 
his tools were theirs but in his somber heart 
he thought of what hed learned and gazed over 
the farflung forest just then by chance he prayed 
i wish the golden branch would show itself 
in this vast wood right nowsince what the sibyl said 
of you misenus turned out all too true 
at his words twin doves flew down from the sky 
landing on the grassy sod before him 
the great hero knew his mothers birds 
and gladly prayed be my guides if theres a path 
and wing your way into the woods wherever 
that lush branch casts shade on loamy soil 
and you my goddess mother help me in my 
hour of need he spoke and stopped to see 
what signs the doves gave where they went 
as they fed the birds flitted from spot to spot 
always staying in his line of sight 
when they reached avernus jaws and reeking gorge 
they quickly rose gliding through the crystal air 
and perched right where hed hoped on the dappled tree 
the golds shining aura shimmered through the branches 
it looked like mistletoe in winters cold when 
its green leaves ring around a fostertrees 
smooth trunk the yellow flowers blooming this was 
how the shining gold appeared growing 
on the shadowed oak rustling in the breeze 
at once aeneas grabbed it he snapped it eagerly 
as it held on and took it to the priestess shrine 
on the shore the trojans mourned misenus 
offering last rites for his thankless embers 
they raised a massive pyre fragrant with pine 
and planks of oak then wove dark foliage 
along its sides and set up gloomy cypresses 
in front his gleaming armor crowned the top 
some prepared hot water boiling it in cauldrons 
they washed and anointed the cold corpse 
and set the man they wept for on a bier groaning 
giving him the purple robes owed to the dead 
others raised the massive litter an unhappy 
duty and set a torch below eyes averted 
for the rite a pile of gifts went up in flames 
frankincense and foodstuff olive oil in bowls 
when the blaze collapsed into gray cinders 
they washed the thirsty ashes his remains with wine 
corynaeus laid the bones in a bronze urn 
and walked around the men three times with sacred 
waterthe dew of a fertile olive branch 
sprinkling it to cleanse them saying the last words 
pious aeneas built the tomb a giant barrow 
topped off with misenus armor oar and trumpet 
below a looming bluff now called misenus 
after him the name will last through all the ages 
next he quickly carried out the sibyls orders 
there is a deep and yawning cave its mouth 
a giant jagged gape a black lake and a forests 
shadow shield it no bird can wing its way 
across it with impunity so putrid is 
the breath its black jaws pour out to the upper air 
for this the greeks called it avernus birdless 
the priestess set four steers with pitchblack hides 
before the altar she poured wine on their heads 
and plucked the tall bristles between their horns 
to throw into the sacred flames as offerings 
next she called on hecate who moves heaven 
and hell they cut the steers throats and caught 
warm blood in bowls aeneas sword struck down 
a black lamb for the furies mother night and her 
sister earth a barren cow for proserpina 
he lit night altars to the stygian king 
setting whole bulls on the flames pouring 
fatty oil over the burning entrails 
at the rising suns first rays the ground rumbled 
and forest ridges shook as hecate approached 
dogs seemed to howl through the halflight 
get out get out unholy ones the sibyl cried 
leave all the grove behind and you aeneas 
quickly grab your weapon from its sheath 
now you must be brave and resolute 
raving she flung herself into her open cave 
aeneas kept pace and not with timid steps 
o gods who govern souls o silent shades chaos 
phlegethon and mute expanses of the night 
let it be right to tell what i have heard let me 
show whats buried deep in earth and darkness 
they went faded figures in the lonely night 
through the lifeless empty realm of dis 
as if through a wood under a clouded moons 
thin light when jove has plunged the sky in shadow 
and black night leaches color from the world 
at the entrance in orcus very jaws 
grief and vengeful sorrow made their beds 
and pale diseases sad old age and fear 
and illadvising hunger and shameful poverty 
forms horrible to see and death and suffering 
then deaths brother slumber and the joys 
of evil men facing them were murderous war 
and the furies iron chambers and mad discord 
her serpent hair bound up with bloody ribbons 
there a giant darkleafed elm spread out 
its ancient branches they say false dreams 
live on it clinging under every leaf 
many other ghastly forms of freaks 
were stabled by the doors centaurs biform scylla 
briareus hundred arms the beast of lerna 
hissing horribly chimaera breathing fire 
gorgons harpies and the ghost of threetrunked 
geryon aeneas shook with sudden fear 
he grabbed his sword and held its naked edge to them 
if his wise guide hadnt chided him that these 
were insubstantial wraiths and flitting images 
hed have rushed to slash the shadows pointlessly 
from here began the path to hellish acherons 
violent whirls of water it seethed and swirled 
belching sand into the river cocytus 
filthy charon wearing stinking rags 
ferried ghosts across the stream his lengthy 
beard was matted stiff his eyes stared fixed 
and fierce a dirty wrap was tied around his neck 
he poled the boat himself tending to the sails 
toting bodies in the dingy raft he was old 
but it was the green and raw old age of gods 
all the crowd came streaming to this shore 
mothers men the lifeless bodies of brave 
heroes boys and unwed girls sons placed 
on the pyre before their parents eyes 
as many as the forest leaves that fall 
in autumns early chill as many as 
the birds who flock to land from sea when winter 
drives them south to sunny lands there 
they stood pleading to be first to cross 
stretching longing hands toward the farther bank 
the surly boatman took now some now others 
the rest he shoved far from the sandy shore 
aeneas was surprised and moved to see the tumult 
he asked why are they rushing to the stream 
what do these souls want why are some left behind 
while others sweep black water with the oars 
the ancient priestess answered in few words 
anchises son the gods true child you see 
the sluggish depths of cocytus and styx 
by which gods fear to swear false oaths all this 
crowd you see lacks burialor any recourse 
the ferryman is charon his passengers have graves 
he cant carry anyone across the awful 
roaring waters till their bones find rest 
they flit around these shores one hundred years 
at last they board and reach the bank theyve craved 
anchises son stopped still and stood mulling over 
many things he pitied these souls unfair fate 
he saw leucaspis and orontes leader of 
the lycian fleet both sad without funerals 
the south wind had submerged the men and ships 
as they sailed on stormswept seas from troy 
now the helmsman palinurus passed by him 
lately on the course from libya as he read 
the stars hed toppled from the stern into deep sea 
aeneas barely making out his sad form 
in the gloom cried out his name what god stole you 
from us and threw you in the sea tell me 
ive never found apollo false but when 
he spoke of you he lied he prophesied 
that youd stay safe across the sea to italy 
is this how he keeps his word but the helmsman 
said apollos cauldron didnt lie to you 
my lord anchises son no god drowned me at sea 
the helm my posting violently swung from me 
as i held it tight and planned our course i fell 
and dragged it with me i swear by the harsh seas 
i feared less for me than for your ship 
her tiller gone her helmsman overboard 
would she founder in the rising waves 
for three winter nights the fierce south wind drove me 
through the endless sea on the fourth dawn 
i could just sight italy from a high waves 
crest i was closing on the shore almost 
safe but as i grabbed rough cliffholds weighed down 
by wet clothes a cruel tribe set on me 
with knives thinking me a prize the fools 
winds and waves now roll me by the shore 
i beg you by the lovely light of sky the air 
by your father and your hopes for young ilus 
save me from this hell since youve overcome it 
and throw soil on my corpse if you reach velia 
or if you have a way if your goddess mother 
shows you one you couldnt ford this stream 
and styxs swamp without divine assistance 
take my poor hand take me on board with you 
so that at least in death ill find a place of rest 
so he begged but the priestess countered 
palinurus why this dread desire to see 
the stygian waters and the furies cruel streams 
to approach the bank unburied and uncalled 
as if the gods fates could be bent by prayer 
but take my words as comfort for your pain 
moved by divine omens nearby folk 
from cities far and wide will appease your shade 
theyll raise a tomb for you and pay due offerings 
that spot will always be called palinurus 
his cares were lifted at these words his sorrow 
banished for a while the name brought him joy 
and so they went on heading for the river 
but from his stream the boatman saw them coming 
from the silent grove and turning to the bank 
he was quick to shout out a rebuke 
you two armed and making for my river 
stop right there and tell me why youre here 
this is a place of shadows of sleep and sleepy night 
living bodies may not ride my stygian boat 
i wasnt pleased to transport hercules 
over the lake nor theseus and pirithos 
and they were sons of gods never defeated 
one wanted to chain tartaruss guarddog 
he dragged him trembling from the kings own throne 
the other planned to steal our queen from diss bed 
apollos seer answered in few words 
we have no such scheme you neednt be upset 
our weapons dont bring violence your guard can scare 
the bloodless shades with barks for all eternity 
the bride can chastely stay inside her uncles home 
aeneas of troy famed for piety and martial 
skill visits his father in the depths of hell 
if this model of great piety means nothing 
at least you know this branch she took it 
from her robe and his swollen heart let go 
its rage no more was said he marveled at 
the sacred gift the fateful branch displayed 
after so long and swung his dark stern to the shore 
expelling all the souls that sat along the transoms 
he cleared the gangway then he boarded huge 
aeneas in his stitchedskin boat it groaned 
under the weight marshwater flooded in 
at last he set them safe across the river man and 
seer onto the slimy mud and graygreen reeds 
there sprawled giant cerberus in a cave 
along the bank he snarled at them from all three throats 
when the priestess saw his snaky hackles rise 
she tossed him a gob of honey and drugged grain 
to make him sleep three starving throats sprang open 
greedy to snatch the morsel then his massive bulk 
slumped to the ground spanning the whole cave 
now that the guard was sunk in sleep aeneas entered 
quick to leave the stream no man could ford again 
at once he could hear voices the loud wails 
and weeping souls of babies cheated of sweet life 
at the start a black day tore them from their 
mothers milk and buried them in bitter death 
next were those wrongly condemned to die 
jurors drawn by lot decided where theyd go 
minos was the magistrate he shook the urn 
and called a council of the dead to judge the crimes 
next were the despondent suicides 
though innocent they threw their lives away 
sick of the light of day how gladly now theyd welcome 
pain and poverty just to breathe the air 
but divine law forbids it the gloomy waves and 
hateful swamp confine them and the nine coils of 
the styx close by he was shown the fields of mourning 
as theyre called they stretched in all directions 
here were those whom heartless love consumed 
with cruel pining secret paths and myrtle trees 
concealed them and their passion lived past death 
he saw phaedra procris and eriphyle 
sadly showing stabs her cruel son inflicted 
pasiphae laodamia and evadne 
with them was caeneus once transformed into a man 
then given back her former shape by fate 
in this great wood phoenician dido her wound 
still fresh wandered with them when the trojan 
hero neared and saw her misty shape among the ghosts 
as when one sees or thinks one sees a new moon 
climbing through the clouds when the month is young 
he spoke to her in tears with tender love 
unhappy dido so the news i heard was true 
youre dead a suicide by the sword but 
did i cause your death i call the stars and gods 
to witness if the underworld allows the truth 
i left your shores against my will o queen 
the orders of the gods which force me now 
to walk through shades and squalor in deep night 
forced me those days too how could i think 
id cause you so much pain by my departure 
stop dont rush from my sight who is it 
you run from fate gives us a final chance to speak 
with these words he tried to soothe the raging soul 
that looked at him so fiercely his tears fell 
but dido turned away her eyes fixed on the ground 
her face just as unaltered by his speech 
as hard flint or a rocky crag of marble 
at last she broke away hatefilled and hurried 
to the shaded forest where sychaeus her first 
husband shared her pain and matched her love 
aeneas was shaken by her unjust death his eyes 
followed her with tears and pity as she left 
he struggled on his given path and now they reached 
the farthest fields set aside for heroes in war 
tydeus met them with parthenopaeus 
great in battle and the shade of pale adrastus 
also trojans who fell fighting lamented 
to the skies he groaned to see the crowded ranks 
thersilochus glaucus medon antenors 
three sons polyboetes priest of ceres 
and idaeus with his chariot and armor 
the souls thronged round him to the left and right 
to see him was too little they wanted to linger 
to walk with him and learn why he had come 
but the greek chiefs and agamemnons army 
shook in fear when they saw the heros weapons 
gleaming in the gloom some turned round to run 
just as they once scuttled to their ships others 
raised a weak warcry that mocked their gaping jaws 
and now he saw deiphobus priams son 
his whole body mangled his face and both his hands 
with cruel gashes ears ripped from his ruined head 
his nose slashed to the nostrilsa shameful injury 
aeneas hardly knew the trembling shade that tried 
to hide its ghastly wounds and questioned his old friend 
great warrior of teucers noble blood 
who chose to punish you so viciously who took 
such liberties on that final night i heard 
you fell onto a heap of mingled corpses 
exhausted from your massacre of greeks 
i raised your empty tomb on rhoeteums shore 
and loudly called your shade three times your name 
and armor mark the place but i never found you 
friend to bury you before i left our country 
friend you left nothing undone said priams son 
you paid the honors due deiphobuss ghost 
my fate and spartan helens heinous crime threw me 
in this hell she left me these souvenirs 
you know we filled that final night with foolish 
revelry you must recall it all too well 
when the deadly horse pregnant with infantry 
entered our citadel helen faked a bacchic 
frenzy and launched the shrieking trojan women 
into dance then she raised a giant torch 
to signal to the greeks from our acropolis 
i was in my luckless marriagebed worn out 
with worry lost in sleep a deep sweet rest 
was pressing on me like the peace of death 
my darling wife removed the weapons from our house 
and stole the trusted sword under my head 
she flung the entrance open and called in menelaus 
no doubt hoping this great favor to her lover 
would erase the infamy of her old sins 
whats left to say he burst in with ulysses 
the father of all crime o gods pay back the greeks 
in kind if i ask for vengeance justly 
but tell me now what brought you here alive 
did you steer off course as you were sailing 
is this some gods command what fate hounds you so 
that youd approach this place of murk and misery 
meanwhile aurora in her rosy chariot 
had crossed the summit of the sky and perhaps 
theyd have used up all their time in talk 
but the sibyl his companion warned him curtly 
night falls fast aeneas we waste our hours weeping 
here the path splits into two on the right 
the route leads past the walls of mighty dis our way 
to elysium the left path sends the wicked 
to their punishment in godless tartarus 
deiphobus replied dont rage at me great priestess 
ill return and take my place among the dead 
go on glory of our land be luckier 
than me so he spoke turning away 
aeneas stole a quick glance back to the left 
under a cliff was a massive fortress ringed with 
triple walls and a raging moat of fire 
phlegethon hurling thunderous rocks 
in front a giant gate and adamantine pillars 
no human force not even warring gods 
could rip them out an iron tower reached the sky 
there tisiphone crouched wakefully her bloody cloak 
hitched high she watched the entrance day and night 
you could hear groans and savage lashstrokes 
irons clanking chains being dragged terrified 
aeneas stopped to listen to the clamor 
virgin what were their crimes what tortures are 
inflicted here why does this wailing fill the air 
the seer began famed leader of the trojans 
no good souls may cross this evil threshold 
when hecate assigned avernus woods to me 
she taught me all the ways gods punish men 
cretan rhadamanthus rules these cruel realms 
he hears and rebukes deceit making men 
confess the secret crimes they relished when alive 
the guilt they pointlessly delayed till deaths late hour 
vengeful tisiphone carrying her whip 
at once leaps down to flay the guilty she thrusts 
her vicious snakes at them calling on her cruel 
sisters finally the awful gate swings open 
with the screech of grating hinges do you see 
her awful lurking shape guarding the entrance 
more savage still is whats inside massive hydra 
her fifty black mouths gaping then tartarus itself 
plunges to a sheer abyss a fall to darkness 
twice as far as when we gaze at high olympus 
the titans are there an ancient race of earth 
struck down by lightning they grovel in the dregs of hell 
i also saw aloeus twins giant bulks 
who tried to tear down heaven with their hands 
and dislodge jupiter from his high realm 
i saw salmoneus paying a cruel price 
for mimicking joves lightning and olympian thunder 
he rode in triumph through greek cities and 
his home town elis brandishing a torch taking 
for himself the honor due the gods the fool 
faking the impossiblestorms and lightning 
with bronze cymbals and the beat of hooves 
the mighty father flung his firebolt through 
the heavy cloudshe didnt need the smoky light 
of sputtering torchesand hurled him straight to hell 
tityus was here fosterson of earth 
his body sprawling through nine acres a filthy 
vulture digs into his deathless liver always 
ripe for torture with its curving beak 
foraging for dinner at home deep in 
his guts the reborn organ gets no rest 
should i mention lapiths pirithos and 
ixion a black cliff looms over them 
on the verge of falling golden legs gleam on 
their couches and a feast of royal opulence 
is spread but the leader of the furies sits 
right there forbidding them to reach for food 
always leaping up raising her torch and shrieking 
all those who loathed their brothers during life 
who beat their parents or caught clients in a web 
of fraud or sat on gold theyd just acquired putting 
no part aside for family the biggest group 
or were murdered in adultery or fought 
in civil wars or broke faith with their masters 
locked up they wait for punishment dont ask 
what punishment theres no one form or fate 
some heave along huge boulders or lie outspread 
on wheelspokes doomed theseus will sit forever 
in a chair and phlegyas who suffers most 
chides all of them and cries among the shades 
be warned learn justice do not scorn the gods 
this one sold his country and let a tyrant 
rule it this one made and remade laws for money 
incest drove one to his daughters bed 
all dared monstrous crimessuccessfully 
a hundred tongues and mouths an iron voice 
wouldnt let me cover the varieties 
of evil nor all the names for punishments 
this said phoebus aged priestess told him come 
return now to the road end the task you started 
we must hurry i can see the ramparts built 
by cyclopian forges and the arching gateway 
our orders were to set the gift down here 
they went along the dark path side by side 
crossed the open ground and reached the doors 
aeneas entered first he sprinkled himself with fresh 
water then set the branch at proserpinas threshold 
they were done the goddess gift delivered 
the fields of joy were next the sweet green groves 
held by the fortunate homes of the blessed 
the fields were bathed in dazzling light by skies 
wider than ours and a different sun and stars 
some exercised in grassy rings or fought 
mock battles grappling on the golden sand 
others stamped their feet in dance singing songs 
the thracian seer was there in his trailing robe 
he played his lyres seven strings in rhythm 
plucking notes with fingers or an ivory pick 
teucers ancient race was there his handsome sons 
greatsouled heroes born in better years ilus 
assaracus and troys founder dardanus 
aeneas marveled at their phantom chariots 
and armor the spears fixed in the earth the horses 
freely grazing far and wide the mens love 
of chariots and armor of feeding their sleek 
stallions lasted after death he saw 
others to the right and left feasting 
in the meadows singing glad odes in groves 
fragrant with laurel where the great stream eridanus 
surfaces to flow among the trees 
here were legions wounded fighting for their 
country priests whod led pure lives pious 
poets with songs worthy of apollo 
men who bettered life by new inventions 
and those whose merit set them down in memory 
all their brows were bound with snowwhite ribbons 
as they thronged around the sibyl spoke to them 
musaeus first he was in the center 
of the crowd tallest by a head she asked 
tell me happy souls and you best among poets 
what land what place holds anchises its for 
his sake weve come fording mighty erebus 
the hero answered briefly no ones home 
is set we live in shady groves or by 
the riverbanks soft bends or meadows sweet 
with streams but if this is what you want you must 
climb this ridge ill show you an easy path 
he walked ahead pointing out the shining fields 
below the other two descended from the heights 
deep in that lush valley father anchises 
made a careful count of gathered souls 
as they waited for the light above he happened 
to be tallying his family his dear 
grandsons fates and fortunes natures and great deeds 
when he saw aeneas coming to him through 
the meadow he stretched out both arms eagerly 
tears ran down his face and he exclaimed 
youve come at last i knew your piety 
would overcome the dangers of the trip do i 
see your face my child and hear that voice i know 
i expected this would happen i counted 
down the days my worrys been rewarded 
youve come so far by land and sea to visit me 
dear son and youve suffered so much hardship 
how i feared that youd be harmed in libya 
he answered father your sad ghost visiting 
so often made me cross this boundary 
our fleet waits on the tuscan sea let me clasp 
your hand dont pull back from my embrace 
tears soaked aeneas face three times he tried 
to wrap his arms around his fathers neck three times 
his hands passed through the insubstantial shade as if 
it were the merest breeze a fleeting dream 
and now aeneas saw at the valleys end 
a sheltered wood with rustling branches and 
the river lethe flowing through this peaceful place 
the souls of countless peoples flitted here 
the way bees haunt a meadows manycolored flowers 
in the still of summer circling round bright 
lilies as the whole field buzzes with their hum 
this sudden sight startled aeneas he asked 
for explanation what is that faroff river 
who are the many men who throng its banks 
anchises said these are the souls to whom 
fate owes new bodies they drink from lethes stream 
it offers peace and long oblivion ive yearned 
so long to show and tell you of them face to 
face this gathering of my family so that 
youd be still happier at finding italy 
but father must we think that some souls pass from here 
to life above taking up the weight of flesh 
again why this awful longing for the light 
ill tell you son anchises said you wont remain 
confused and he explained each thing in order 
first the sky and land and liquid fields of sea 
the silvery sphere of moon and titan the sun 
spirit nurtures them within and minds infused 
throughout animating mass and mixing with it 
from here comes the race of men and beasts the lives 
of birds the monsters under oceans marble surface 
these seeds have a fiery vigor and their source 
is heavenly but harmful matter slows them down 
and theyre blunted by our bodies which must die 
so men fear and want grieve and feel glad 
locked in this dark dungeon they cant perceive the sky 
poor things even when life leaves them on the day 
of death not every sin or canker of the flesh 
fully recedes many habits harden 
over time and in this way become ingrained 
so they pay for former crimes by torment 
exposed to hollow winds by crucifixion 
washed clean of infection in a whirling flood 
or cauterized by firewe all suffer our souls 
cure then were sent to wide elysium 
a few of us stay in this happy place 
until long years have purged the final taint of matter 
and times great wheel has come full circle only 
ethers spirit the fire of pure air remains 
when the rest have cycled through a thousand years 
the god calls them in clusters to the river lethe 
these forgetful spirits hope for resurrection 
into bodies they start to want to see the sky 
falling quiet anchises drew his son and sibyl 
to the center of the bustling crowd 
from a hill he studied the men marching by 
and knew their faces in the long procession 
come he said ill reveal the future glory 
of our trojan lineage and the italians 
who wait for us splendid souls wholl take our name 
ill teach you your destiny do you see 
the young man leaning on the headless spear 
by lot hell be the next to reach the light 
above his blood mingled with italys 
silvius an alban name your lastborn son 
lavinia your wife will bear him in a forest 
when youre elderly a king to other kings 
a father through him our race will rule in alba longa 
next is famous procas glory of the trojan 
race then capys numitor and your namesake 
silvius aeneas your match in piety 
and weaponsif he can take up albas throne 
what young mensee the great strength that they show 
the civic crowns of oak leaves on their heads 
theyll found nomentum gabi fidena 
theyll set collatias fortress on the hills 
pometi castrum inu bola and 
cora will be names now just nameless lands 
mars son romulus will join his grandfather 
on earth trojan through his mother ilia 
do you see his helmets double crests 
his father honored him with his own emblem 
under his rule shining rome will spread 
her empire through the world her spirit to olympus 
and set a single wall around her seven hills 
shell be rich in sonslike towercrowned cybele 
riding in her chariot through phrygian towns 
happy in the gods she bore a hundred grandsons 
in her arms all divine all heavendwellers 
now turn your eyes look at this race your romans 
here is caesar with all of ilus children 
wholl come under the skys great axis and here 
the man you hear so often promised to you 
augustus caesar born of gods wholl bring 
a golden age to latium where saturn lived 
and push his empire past the garamants 
and indians to lands beyond our stars 
beyond suns yearly path where atlas hoists the sky 
turning the starstudded sphere on his shoulder 
even caspian lands and the black sea dread his 
approach they already fear the prophecies 
the seven deltas of the nile tremble in terror 
hercules himself did not cross so much land 
although he shot the bronzehoofed deer brought peace 
to erymanthus woods and scared the lerna with 
his bow nor triumphant bacchus using vines 
to steer his team of tigers as he drives down nysas 
summit will we hesitate to put our courage 
to the test does fear keep us from our home 
in italy whos that far off distinct with his 
olive crown and offerings i see the gray beard 
of king numa called from humble cures 
and its pauper fields to power hell impose 
the rule of law next is tullus who will 
shatter the lands peace and push into armed 
ranks slow men long since unused to triumph 
the boaster ancus follows him even now 
too taken with the masses favor do you wish 
to see the tarquin kings and the proud soul 
of brutus the avenger who won back the fasces 
hell be the first to hold a consuls power and 
the cruel axes for lovely liberty hell kill 
his own sons when they stir up revolution 
unhappy man however later ages tell it 
his love of country wonand his great greed for glory 
far off you see the drusi and the decii 
torquatus brutal axman and camillus savior 
of the standards that shining pair in matching armor 
in concord now while darkness presses them 
if they ever reach the light of life ah 
the wars the slaughter theyll stir up the fatherinlaw 
swoops down from his alpine ramparts and 
monoecus heights while his sonin law masses 
the eastern enemy my sons dont warm to war 
dont turn your sword against your countrys heart 
you who trace your blood back to olympus stop first 
drop your weapon from your hand my kin 
this ones fame comes from the greeks he killed at corinth 
hell ride in victory to the lofty capitol 
that one will destroy argos agamemnons 
mycene and perseus great achilles 
heir avenging troy and minervas looted 
temple whod omit great cato or you cossus 
or the gracchi and two scipios libyas 
ruin thunderbolts of war fabricius 
powerful though poor serranus sowing furrows 
you fabii why hurry maximus 
youll be the only one to save our land by lagging 
others i believe will beat out bronze that seems 
to breathe and chisel living faces out of marble 
theyll excel in pleading lawsuits and theyll trace 
the heavens paths and chart the rising stars 
you roman remember your own arts to rule 
the world with law impose your ways on peace 
grant the conquered clemency and crush the proud in war 
they were struck with awe anchises added 
see claudius marcellus marked by splendid spoils 
victorious he strides along the tallest there 
this horseman will steady roman power 
in a time of chaos trample rebel gaul and 
carthage and for the third time offer captured arms 
to romulus aeneas saw a handsome young man 
near marcellus in bright armor but his face 
showed little joy and his eyes were downcast 
he asked anchises who is that who goes with him 
a son a sons son from this noble stock 
how his comrades cheer what a fine impression 
but black night flaps around his head with her grim shadow 
then tears welled in anchises eyes my child 
dont ask about the great grief of your people 
the fates will offer us the merest glimpse of him 
they wont let him live long would the romans seem 
too powerful to you o gods if he were ours 
what mighty groans of men the field of mars 
will send to our great city what a funeral 
youll see tiber as you pass his tombs fresh soil 
no other trojan boy will so exalt the hopes 
of his latin forefathers nor will the land 
of romulus ever boast his like again 
his piety oldtime honor and unconquered 
strength hed have had no equal in a fight 
no matter if he met the enemy on foot 
or horse spurring on his stallions sweaty flanks 
unhappy boy if you can change your cruel fate 
youll be a true marcellus fill my arms with lilies 
ill scatter these bright flowers for your soul 
my kinjust poor offerings and an empty 
rite so they passed through the whole region 
in the misty air and surveyed it all 
anchises led his son through every sight 
and fired his spirit with a love of future glory 
then he told him of the wars hed have to fight 
and spoke of the laurentians and latinus 
town the hardships to avoid those to endure 
there are twin gates of sleep one they say is made 
of horn and lets true visions pass through easily 
the other gleams with complex work in ivory 
but through it shades send lying visions to the light 
anchises and the sibyl brought aeneas 
to this gate and sent him through he hurried 
to the ships and joined his crew they sailed 
along the coastline to caietas harbor 
and cast anchor the sterns rested on the shore 
book 
caieta once aeneas nurse you died here too 
the city named for you now has eternal fame 
this honor marks your bones and resting place 
in great hesperiaif that is any glory 
after her burial rites when the gravemound had been 
raised pious aeneas waited for calm seas 
then made his way from port under full sail 
the breezes blew past sundown and the shining moon 
lit up their path the ocean gleamed with shivery light 
first they grazed the shores of circe the suns 
wealthy daughter around her dangerous groves 
resounded with her singing in her lofty halls 
she kindled cedar to dispel the dark and wove 
a whirring shuttle through her looms fine warp 
from here they faintly heard the angry growls 
of lions yanking at their chains and roaring late at night 
and bristly boars and bears raging in pens and huge 
howling shapes of wolveshuman once but 
altered from their form by the cruel goddesss 
magic herbs they wore the face and fur of beasts 
to spare the pious trojans from the horrors 
of this port and hateful shore neptune 
filled their sails with helping winds and pushed 
their ships to safety past the foaming shoals 
the sea began to blush with sun and saffron dawn 
high in her rosy chariot shone bright 
suddenly the winds died down and every gust 
was still the oars pulled slowly in the marble sea 
then aeneas on his ship saw a lengthy 
stretch of woodland at that spot the lovely tiber 
yellow with thick sand and churning eddies 
burst into the sea all around the varied 
birds for whom the banks and stream were home 
caressed the sky with song and flew among the trees 
he told his crew to point the prows to land 
happily they sailed into the shaded stream 
come erato ill unfold the kings the times 
the state of ancient latium when foreign troops 
first landed on italian shores ill call 
to memory the incidents that started war 
goddess guide your poet ill tell of brutal clashes 
battle lines courage that sent kings to death 
etruscan warriors and all of italy 
in arms a greater series of events begins 
a greater task for me 
elderly king latinus 
ruled these fields and quiet cities in long peace 
they say that faunus fathered him on marica 
a laurentian nymph faunus father picus 
traced his blood to saturn founder of the race 
by the gods decree latinus had no sons 
one was lost to him in childhood a single 
daughter tended that great housenow of age 
and ready for a husband many from wide 
latium and italy were wooing her 
turnus was the handsomest of all and 
of noble ancestry the royal queen was keen 
to make him soninlaw her love for him was striking 
but sacred omens blocked this with a string of horrors 
a laurel tree with holy leaves stood in the royal 
homes inner court revered for many years 
they say father latinus found this tree 
when he built the citadel he made it sacred 
to apollo and named his folk laurentians 
now a swarm of bees amazing occupied 
its crown sailing through the clear air 
with a mighty buzz they wove their feet and formed 
an instant beehive hanging from a leafy branch 
at once the seer pronounced i see a foreign man 
arriving with an armyhis path his goal 
are like the bees he plans to take our heights 
then when chaste lavinia lit the altar 
with a sacred torch standing by her father 
they saw her long hair catch on firehorrible 
her headdress crackled as flames scorched it 
the tiara bright with many gems blazed up 
she herself engulfed in smoke and orange 
light scattered sparks through all the house 
this was felt to be miraculous and awful 
seers foresaw that shed be famed in life 
and legend but bring great conflict to her people 
the king worried by these omens visited 
the oracle of faunus his prophetic father 
in great albuneas grove which echoes 
with a sacred spring the air is foul 
and dark here the italians and all 
oenotria seek guidance when in doubt once a 
seer has given gifts he lies in the silent night 
on pelts of sheep hes killed waiting for dreams 
and sees an eerie host of phantoms flit around 
with varied voices he has the right to speak 
with gods he talks to acheron in deep avernus 
here latinus likewise seeking answers 
sacrificed a hundred woolly sheep 
he spread their pelts and lay on them to rest 
a sudden voice spoke out from the deep grove 
dont wed your daughter to the latins son 
dont trust the marriage thats already planned 
foreigners will come to be your sonsinlaw 
theyll raise our name up to the stars by blood 
their sons will see the world under their feet 
theyll rule as far as both the seas seen by the circling 
sun latinus didnt hide what faunus said 
the warning given in the silent night 
when the men from troy tied fast their fleet 
to the rivers grassy bank flitting rumor 
had already spread it through italian towns 
aeneas handsome ilus and the leading princes 
sprawled under a trees high branches to prepare 
their meal they set flatbreads on the grass 
as plates for food so jupiter himself advised 
and added woodland fruits to these spelt disks 
by chance when everything was eaten hunger 
made them gnaw the thin round crusts and break 
with daring hands and mouths the disks of fateful 
bread quartered sections one and all 
see we eat our tables too said ilus 
only that a joke but this comment 
marked the end of hardship stunned aeneas 
seized on ilus words and hushed his son 
he spoke at once i greet you country owed to me 
by fate and you the faithful gods of trojan hearths 
this is our home your native land my father 
i remember left me with this fateful secret 
when you come to unknown shores my son 
and hunger makes you eat your tables then 
despite exhaustion know youre home set your buildings 
here first and heap ramparts around them 
this was that same hunger this was the last 
trial we had to face an end to exile 
at suns first light lets happily explore 
this land and learn who lives in it and where 
theyve set their towns well branch out from the port 
now honor jove with offerings pray to father 
anchises and refresh the altars wine 
he wound a leafy sprig around his head 
calling on the local guardian spirit earth 
the first of gods nymphs and unknown streams 
then night its rising constellations idas jove 
and the phrygian mother all in order 
then his parents one in heaven one in hades 
the mighty father thundered three times loudly 
in the clear sky and flourished in his hand 
a cloud that blazed with golden rays from high above 
at once rumor swept the trojan ranks 
the time had come to build the fated walls 
quickly they renewed the feast setting up 
and garlanding the wine glad at the great omen 
at the start of day when titans torch lit up 
the land they scattered to spy out the towns 
the coast and country here was numicus lake 
here the river tiber here lived strong latins 
aeneas picked a hundred envoys of all ranks 
and sent them to latinus lordly home 
decked with branches from athenas olive tree 
and taking presents for the king to ask for peace 
no delay they rushed off at a rapid pace 
meanwhile he traced future walls with shallow trenches 
on the shore building his first town circling 
it with parapets and ramparts like a camp 
when the envoys came they saw the latins towers 
and high homes and passed under the city gate 
outside the walls boys and young men in their prime 
trained horses in the dust tamed teams for chariots 
pulled bows taut or hurled vibrating lances 
challenging each other to boxing or a race 
one rode ahead to tell the aged king imposing 
men in foreign clothes had come to latium 
latinus had them called inside the palace 
and took his seat on his ancestral throne 
on the city peak laurentian picus palace 
rose up huge and hallowed on a hundred columns 
a site eerie with woods and ancient rituals 
auspicious kings received their scepters and the rods 
of office here their senatehouse and sacred feasts 
were here and here at lengthy tables the elders 
sat to eat after theyd sacrificed a ram 
statues of the ancestors stood in a row 
inside the vestibule hewn of ancient cedar 
italus the vinegrower sabinus 
with his curving scythe ancient saturn 
and the bust of twofaced janus other early 
kings and those wounded fighting for their country 
many weapons too hung on the sacred doorposts 
captured chariots and curving axblades crests of 
helmets giant bolts from city gates spears and 
shields bronze prows torn from ships picus himself 
the horsetamer sat there with an augurs staff 
his tunic edged in purple a sacred shield 
in his left hand his lover circe lost to lust 
used her golden wand and drugs to change him 
to a bird and sprinkled colors on his wings 
in this holy temple on his ancestral throne 
latinus called the teucrians inside 
when they came he said to them serenely 
speak dardanians we know your city 
and your race wed heard that you were sailing here 
why what cause what need carried your ships 
to italy through spans of dark blue sea 
perhaps you lost your way or storms blew you 
off coursesailors often meet with such bad luck 
youve traveled up our stream you dock at our harbor 
dont reject our welcome the latins are the race 
of saturn no chains or laws compel us to be just 
only free willwe keep our old gods ways 
i recall the story dims with passing years 
how old auruncans claimed that dardanus born 
in these fields later left for phrygian idas 
towns and thracian samosnow its samothrace 
he sailed from here his tuscan home of corythus 
these days his throne is in the starry skys gold 
court his altars add to the gods numbers 
ilioneus answered him my king 
distinguished son of faunus no dark storms 
or torrents forced us to your land nor did 
stars and coastlines lead us off our course 
we came on purpose to this city willingly 
driven from our kingdomonce the greatest 
the sun saw as he came from high olympus 
our race goes back to jupiter we men 
rejoice in this our king has joves great blood 
aeneas of troy who sent us to your shores 
the fierce storm the vicious greeks unleashed on idas 
fields how fortune made the worlds of asia 
and europe clash in warthis everyone has heard 
even those who hold the farthest lands cut off 
by oceans tides even those beyond the zone 
of scorching sun the middle of the earths five tracts 
we sailed from that cataclysm across many 
seas we beg a small home for our native gods 
a harmless stretch of shore with air and water 
we wont disgrace your kingdom your fame and our 
gratitude for such a gift will never fade 
italy will not regret she welcomed trojans 
i swear this on aeneas life and strong right hand 
by which pacts were made and battles fought 
many tribes and nations sought us for themselves 
and hoped to make us allies dont scorn us if we come 
with olive sprigs and words of supplication 
the gods fate made us seek your land dardanus 
began here and here dardanians return 
apollo sends us urgent orders come back 
to tuscan tiber and numicus sacred pools 
our leader also brings small tokens of our former 
glory relics saved from burning troy with this 
gold cup anchises poured libations at the altar 
and this was priams finery when he judged 
the nations a sacred scepter and a diadem 
and robes that trojan women toiled to weave 
latinus fixed his gaze upon the ground 
his face was still but his eyes moved in thought 
the clothing stitched in purple didnt move him 
nor did priams scepter his daughters marriage 
was a far greater concern he reflected 
on the oracle of ancient faunus 
was this the man foretold by fate whod come 
from foreign lands to be his soninlaw to share 
his power equally would this race excel 
in bravery and overcome the world by force 
he spoke at last with joy may the gods support 
our plan and their prophecy youll get your wish 
trojan i dont spurn your gifts while i rule 
you wont lack for fertile land or miss troys wealth 
just let aeneas come himself if he so much 
wants to be my guestfriend and my ally 
he shouldnt fear kindly faces my condition 
for this pact will be to clasp his hand in mine 
you then take this message to your king 
i have a daughter but my fathers shrine 
and many omens warn me not to marry her 
to one of us its said my soninlaw will come 
from overseas to latium that our blood 
will lift our name up to the stars i think 
the fates demand your kingand if im right 
im ready latinus picked out horses from his 
stables whose high stalls held three hundred he sent them 
to the trojans right away stallions 
with saddlecloths of purple thread golden 
neckchains dangled from their chests their coverings 
were gold and their teeth champed on gold bridles 
he sent a chariot for absent aeneas 
and a horseteam of celestial stock their nostrils 
snorting fire they came from crossbreeds bred by clever 
circe whod mated stallions stolen from her father 
with mortal mares aeneas men returned on them 
with latinus gifts and words and news of peace 
cruel juno was just coming back from argos 
inachus town in her airborne chariot 
far off from the skies of sicily she saw 
glad aeneas and the trojan fleet she saw 
their houses rising sailors trusting to the land 
the ships unmanned stopping short pierced with pain 
she shook her head and poured out heartfelt words 
oh no that hated race those phrygian fates opposed 
to mine why didnt they perish on sigeums fields 
why wont these losers lose why didnt they burn 
in burning troy so theyve found a way 
through war and conflagration is my power spent 
or my loathing satisfied these fugitives 
i hated them and dared to hunt them through the waves 
i fought these exiles across every ocean 
the strength of sea and sky was used up on these men 
what use was scylla or the syrtes or awful 
charybdis now the trojans settle by the longedfor 
tiber safe from seaand me mars could 
kill off all the giant lapiths the gods father 
gave up ancient calydon to soothe 
dianas rage undeserving victims both 
but i joves mighty wife who dared everything 
i could who turned to every tactic im losing 
to aeneas if my powers arent enough 
why not stoop to begging anyone if i 
cant move the gods above then ill move acheron 
granted i cant keep him from his latin kingdom 
i cant change lavinias destined marriage 
but i can delay crucial events i can 
destroy their nations let soninlaw and father 
join the price will be their people my girl 
your dowry will be blood rutulian and latin 
bellona waits to be your bridesmaid hecuba 
wont be the only woman to give birth 
to wedding flames venus son will be the same 
a second paris a fatal torch for this new troy 
shes done the dreadful goddess makes for land 
she rousts the griefbringer allecto from the furies 
lair in hells dark murk she who relishes 
grim wars and rage and treachery and evil crimes 
even her father pluto and her hellish sisters 
hate this monsterso many are her awful forms 
and faces so many black snakes swarm on her 
juno goads her with these words virgin 
born of night take on this task a favor just for 
me save my name and honor from disgrace 
and ruin dont allow aeneas men to sway 
latinus with a marriage and seize italy 
you cause loving brothers to seize swords you wreck 
families with feuds and visit whips and death 
on homes you have a thousand names and ways of harm 
look into your box of tricks undo the pact 
of peace and sow the crimes of war let men 
want swords seek them seize them instantly 
allecto steeped in serpent venom swooped at once 
to the laurentian rulers halls in latium 
and stalked amatas silent door the queen 
was seething with a womans angst and anger 
trojans had arrivedwas turnus marriage safe 
now allecto flung a snake from her black hair 
it pierced amata then plunged deep into her heart 
to derange her into ruining her own home 
with viperish breath it slid between her clothing and 
smooth breasts too subtle to be felt in her mad state 
the giant snake became a golden chain 
around her throat then melded with her headband 
unobserved it wove into her hair and slunk 
across her frame at first while the poison just 
attacked her senses winding fire round her bones 
before she felt the full flame in her heart 
she still spoke gently like a mother shedding 
tears for her daughter and the phrygian wedding 
will you give lavinia to these trojan exiles 
dont you pity her or yourself her father 
or me whom that lying pirate will abandon 
at first breeze departing with his stolen bride 
this is how that trojan shepherd came to sparta 
and stole ledas daughter helen off to troy 
what about your oath your old love for your people 
the pledge you gave so often to my nephew turnus 
if her husband must be foreign to the latins 
and father faunus orders bind you i say 
every land is outside if our kingdom doesnt 
rule it thats what the gods meant turnus too 
if you trace his peoples origin is from 
acrisius and inachus a mycenean 
but when she saw that he opposed her and 
her words were wasted and when the furys poison 
penetrated to her bones pervading her 
then poor amata goaded by the monster 
rampaged in a shameless frenzy through the city 
like a spinning top that whirls under the whip 
when little boys intent on play lash it round 
an empty yard in circles the childish band 
is captivated by its curving path 
and wonders at the spinning boxwood toy 
given life by blows just so amata whirled 
across the city and its warlike people 
she faked a bacchic trance and flew into the forest 
committing worse crimes as her madness 
grew she hid her daughter in the leafy hills 
to rob the trojans of their torchlit wedding 
shrieking bacchus only you deserve her 
she holds the pinetopped stalk for you she honors 
you in dance for you she tends long hair 
rumor flew right away the same strong urge 
to find new homes drove all the raving mothers 
they left home wearing fawnskins their heads bared 
to wind or filled the air with warbling howls 
holding vinebranches as spears the queen herself 
stood in the center with a burning torch fevered 
singing wedding hymns for turnus and her daughter 
her bloodshot eyes darting around she shouted 
fiercely latin mothers hear me all of you 
if your pious hearts still care for sad amata 
if you feel anguish for a mothers rights 
untie your hair and join my bacchic revelry 
with bacchus goads allecto whirled the mad queen 
everywhere through the woods and dens of beasts 
once she saw shed honed amatas fury well 
and ruined latinus plans and family 
at once her dark wings took the awful goddess 
to daring turnus town they say that dana 
built it with greek settlers when the swift south wind 
carried her there in old times it was called 
ardea and the names still famous but her peak 
is past here turnus was sleeping soundly 
under his high roof in dark of night 
allecto shed her fierce face and furys body 
taking on the look of an old woman 
she lined her ugly brow with wrinkles added 
headbands and white hair and wove in olive sprigs 
becoming ancient calybe priestess of juno 
she stood in front of him and said turnus 
will you let so much effort go to waste 
and yield your scepter to the dardan settlers 
the king denies you marriage and the dowry won 
by blood a foreign heir is chosen for the throne 
go then fool face thankless danger mow down 
tuscan soldiers keep the latins safe 
almighty juno ordered me to say this to you 
as you rested in the calm of night get up 
gladly arm your men and march them out 
to battle from the gates set afire the phrygian 
chiefs and painted ships camped by our lovely stream 
the gods great power calls for it if king latinus 
wont perform the wedding that he swore to let him 
pay the price and learn what turnus is in war 
scoffing at the priestess the young man said 
the news that ships have sailed the tibers stream 
has not escaped my ears as you think 
dont exaggerate the danger nor has juno 
lost her love for me but as for you old age 
and cobwebs have the better of you auntie 
they cause you false concern tricking a seer 
with silly fears and the fights of kings your jobs 
to guard the statues and the temples of the gods 
men will manage war and peace this is their work 
hearing this allecto blazed up in a rage 
and even as he spoke a sudden seizure took him 
his eyes bulged in terror so many serpents hissed 
around the awful form he saw he struggled to say 
more but she turned wild burning eyes on him 
and shoved him back two snakes rose from her hair 
she cracked her whip and said from rabid lips 
look here i am bested by old age 
and cobwebs tricked by silly fears and the fights 
of kings ive come from my deadly sisters home 
and in my hand i bring you war and death 
she hurled a firebrand at the man smoking 
with dark light it sank deep into his chest 
a dreadful fear cut off his drowsiness at once 
sweat poured down and soaked him to the bone 
crazed he roared for weapons looked for them in bed 
and in the house battlefrenzy boiled in him 
and lust for war but anger mostlike a seething 
cauldron sitting over flaming twigs they crackle 
and the liquid dances with the heat then the froth 
rises and the boiling water bubbles over 
and spills out thick vapor rises in the air 
the peace was ruined turnus told his chiefs to march 
on king latinus they should arm themselves 
save italy expel the enemy he could 
handle both the trojans and the latins 
he called the gods as witness to his vows 
the rutulians urged each other on 
turnus handsome youth and strength moved some 
some his royal blood some his fame in fighting 
while turnus filled rutulian hearts with courage 
allectos stygian wings propelled her to the trojans 
with a new idea she checked the riverbank 
and saw bright ilus flushing game into his snares 
the fury cast a sudden frenzy on his dogs 
she daubed the wellknown scent of deer onto their snouts 
so theyd be hot to hunt this was the first 
cause of conflict this roused country folk for war 
there was a gorgeous stag with giant antlers 
which tyrrhus and his sons had taken from 
its mothers teats and rearedtyrrhus keeper 
of the royal herds and the kings wide fields 
silvia their sister groomed this docile deer 
with love she twined soft garlands around his antlers 
combed his coat and washed him in the clear springs 
he let her pat him and ate from the masters table 
hed wander through the forest and willingly return 
however late at night to the door he knew 
this stag was far from home following the river 
down the grassy banks where the heat was less 
ilus frothing dogs on the chase surprised him 
ascanius himself on fire to win high praise 
aimed an arrow from his curving bow some god 
firmed his wobbling hand and the shaft 
flew hissing through the deers flank and belly 
he fled wounded to the safety of his home 
and made it to his stall moaning bloody 
filling the house with cries as if begging for help 
sylvias the first to beat her arms in grief 
she calls her hardy countrymen to help 
theyre there suddenly dread allecto still hid 
in those silent woods one with a charred stake 
one a heavy knotted club what each man gropes for 
his rage makes a weapon tyrrhus by chance 
was splitting oaks in four pounding in the wedges 
he calls his troops and grabs his ax breathing fury 
the cruel goddess sees her chance for sabotage 
she rushes from her lookout to the stable roof 
and sounds the shepherds signal from on high 
her bugle blares a hellish sound at once 
the deep woods shudder echoing the sound 
dianas distant lake hears it and nars river 
white with sulfur and velinus springs 
scared mothers press their children to their breast 
rough farmers quick to answer seize their swords 
and run from everywhere toward the frightful 
sound the trojans likewise break up camp 
pouring out to bring ascanius support 
battle lines are drawn this is not some rustic 
brawl with heavy clubs and firecharred stakes 
they fight with twoedged swords a black crop 
of iron bristles far and wide bronze armor 
flashes in the sun its light reflected by 
the cloudslike wavecrests whitening when the wind 
picks up the ocean rises slowly the swells build 
at last waves tower from the seabed to the sky 
now a whistling arrow drops a young man 
out in frontalmo tyrrhus oldest son 
the wound lodges in his throat blood wells up 
to choke his breath and bubbling tries at speech 
many corpses fall around him old galaesus 
too as he comes up to plead for peace most just 
of men richest in italian pastures five flocks 
of bleating sheep five herds of cows grazed on 
his grounds a hundred plowshares tilled his land 
with both sides matched the battle rages on the plain 
so allectoher promise fulfilled the war 
now steeped in blood and men already killed 
leaves italy and whirls airborne to juno 
she reports in the proud tone of a victor 
see my acts discord and the grief of war 
now let them be friends or join in treaties 
ive splashed the trojans with italian blood 
ill add this too if you say you want it 
ill spread the war to nearby towns with rumors 
and fire their souls with insane lust for war 
so theyll run to help from all around ill sow 
the fields with swords but juno says enough 
of terror and deceit the causes of the war 
are set they fight hand to hand fresh blood wets 
the weapons chance provided let venus peerless son 
and king latinus celebrate such wedding rites 
the lord of high olympus does not want you 
wandering at will through the breezes of the sky 
leave this place if theres further need 
for action ill take care of it myself 
allecto raises wings that hiss with snakes 
and leaves the heavens for her home in cocytus 
in central italy at the foot of mountains 
theres a famous place spoken of by many 
the valley of amsanctus all around dark forest 
rings it with dense leaves at the center 
a loud torrent spins and tumbles boulders 
theres an eerie cave with holes for cruel diss 
breath to rise from a massive craters reeking 
jaws acheron erupts here the fury 
hides her hated power relieving earth and sky 
meanwhile saturns daughter adds her final flourish 
to the war all the shepherds from the front 
rush into town bringing back the dead boy 
almo and galaesus with his mangled face 
they implore the gods and call upon latinus 
hearing cries of murder in the heated crowd 
turnus feeds their fear trojans are called to rule 
our blood will mix with phrygian ill be banished 
those whose mothers gamboled in a bacchic trance 
among the pathless groves drawn by amatas name 
come together from all sides and call for battle 
through some malign influence now everyone 
demands wars horrorsagainst omens against fate 
they crowd and push around latinus house 
he stands like a rock steadfast against the sea 
when crashing breakers come its way a mass 
that doesnt move as waves smash all around it 
the cliffs and foamy reefs roar uselessly 
seaweed slams its side and slurps back out to sea 
but the king cant stop the reckless plan 
it goes as savage juno wills it even though 
he calls so often on the gods and empty breezes 
fate has broken us a storm sweeps us away 
he cries my poor people youll pay the price 
for blood you spill unjustly turnus your crime 
will reap harsh punishment youll beg the gods 
too late now i retirerobbed of a good 
death in my old age he fences himself 
in his house and drops the reins of state 
there was a custom in italian latium 
which alban towns have since held sacred great rome 
observes it when shes roused to fight and wreak 
wars sorrows on the getae or hyrcani 
or the arabs to march eastward to india 
and claim our standards from the parthians 
there are twin gates of war by name feared 
and revered in the cult of cruel mars 
a hundred brazen bolts and irons eternal strength 
bind them their watchman janus never leaves his post 
when the elders have resolved on war the consul 
marked out by his gabine belt and quirine toga 
unlocks the creaking gates and calls for war 
the men muster bronze horns blare with hoarse 
assent this is the custom that latinus 
should have observed in raising war against 
aeneas men to open the grim gates 
but the father of his people will not touch them 
rejecting that foul task he hides himself in shadows 
so juno herself queen of gods glides down 
and strikes the sluggish portal with her hand 
the hinges turn the iron gates of war burst open 
italy so calm and steadfast once is blazing 
some leave on foot across the fields some wildly stir up 
dust on rearing stallions all want weapons 
men rub down their shields and spears with grease 
polish them and whet axes on grindstones theyre glad 
to hoist the standards to hear the trumpets blast 
five great cities set up anvils to forge arms 
strong atina and proud tibur ardea 
crustumerium and towered antemnae 
they hammer hollow helmets and bend willowstalks 
for shields some forge breastplates out of bronze 
and shining greaves from pliant silver the honor due to 
plow and sickle all their love of farminggone 
they recast their fathers swords the trumpets give 
the sign the watchwords shared in a rush one grabs 
a helmet from his house another drives his trembling 
horses to the yoke grabbing his shield and 
golden threeplied chain mail his trusty sword 
o muses open helicons gates of song for me 
which kings were roused to war which chiefs and armies 
filled the fields what men were raised on italys 
rich soil back then what weapons fed her fire 
you remember goddesses and you can tell it 
only the faintest breath of legend wafts to us 
the first to enter war is harsh mezentius 
from tuscan shores a despiser of the gods 
and his troops lausus his son is near breaker 
of horses hunter of beasts no man is more 
handsome except laurentian turnus lausus 
brings a thousand soldiers with him from caere 
but in vain he deserves more than his fathers 
orders and a father not mezentius 
next aventinus handsome son of handsome 
hercules parades his palmdecked chariot 
and winning team his shield sports his fathers emblem 
hydra circled by a hundred snakes the priestess 
rhea bore him secretly into the realm 
of light within the woods of aventine 
she slept with the god herculeshed just 
murdered geryon and reached laurentian fields 
where he washed his spanish cows in tuscan waters 
his men bring spears and savage pikes to war 
they fight with tapered swords and samnite bayonets 
a giant cape sweeps round their leader a matted 
lionskin that once was herculess cloak 
the awful mane and ivory teeth rest on his head 
like this a horrid sight he walks into the palace 
next twin brothers from the town of tibur 
named for tiburtus their other brother 
catillus and keen coras men of argive origin 
they rush to the front through a sea of weapons 
like two cloudborn centaurs hurtling down 
a mountain peak leaving homole and snowy 
othrys at a breakneck pace the huge forest 
yields to them branches buckle and snap loudly 
praenestes founder caeculus is there as well 
every age has thought him born to vulcan 
in a herd of cows a king discovered 
at the hearth he comes with a rustic legion 
drawn from far and wide men from high praeneste 
the fields of junos gabi cold anio and 
hernican crags dewy with streams men you nourish 
rich anagnia and you too amasenus 
not all have weapons clanging shields or chariots 
most sling pellets of black lead others hold two 
spears in their hands on their heads they wear 
gray wolfskin caps their custom is to march 
with bare left feet rawhide boots cover the right 
messapus the horsebreaker son of neptune 
protected by the gods from death by sword or fire 
at once calls to arms his soldiers so long idle 
his troops unused to war and grips his sword again 
theyre from fescennia and aequi falisci 
soractes heights flavinias fields ciminus 
mountain lake and capenas woods 
they march in ranks and hymn their king 
like snowy swans among the drifting clouds 
coming back from feeding when they call 
in rhythm from long throats the river cayster 
and its asian marshlands echo far and wide 
no one would think armored ranks of a huge force 
were mingling here rather that an airy cloud 
of raucous birds was blown from open seas to shore 
heres clausus of ancient sabine blood he brings 
a great armyhimself a match for it his tribe 
of claudians has now fanned out through latium 
ever since the sabines joined with rome with him 
a huge corps from amiternum old quirites 
a band from eretum soldiers from mutuscas 
groves nomentum and velinas fields 
tetricas rough crags mount severus 
casperia foruli and the stream himella 
men who drink the tiber or the fabaris 
men from freezing nursia the ortine ranks

allia as many as the waves that cross 
the libyan sea when harsh orion dips in winter 
waters as dense as cornears parched by eastern sun 
on hermus plains or the tawny fields of lycia 
shields clang earth trembles at the tramp of feet 
halaesus agamemnons son hater of troy 
yokes horses to his chariot he sweeps along 
a thousand fierce tribes for turnus men who plow 
massicas vinerich soil men sent by auruncan 
elders from their hills those from cales and 
sidicinums plain men from the banks of 
shallow volturnus rough types from saticula 
and a throng of oscans carrying smooth spears 
that come with leather throwingstraps they battle 
hand to hand with sabers and hold lefthanded shields 
oebalus my poem wont pass over you 
they say that telon sired you with the nymph sebethis 
late in life when he ruled the teleboeans 
in capreae his fathers holdings didnt sate 
the son now he lords it over broader land 
the sarrastian tribes plains watered by the sarnus 
rufrae batulum the fields of celemna 
and men within the walls of applerich abella 
they throw boomerangs like german tribes 
and strip the bark of corktrees for the helmets 
on their heads their bronze weapons shimmer 
ufens you were sent to war from hilly nersae 
you have great fame for luck in battle your men 
are unkempt aequiculans who feed themselves 
by hunting in the forests their soil is hard 
they work the earth while armed and love to seize 
new spoils and to live off what they steal 
next priest umbro of the marruvi 
bravest of men sent by king archippus 
his helmet decked with fronds of fertile olive 
he has the skill to sprinkle sleep on venombreathing 
snakes and vipers by his spells and touch 
with his art he charms their anger heals their bites 
but he cant cure a wound from trojan iron 
his mesmerizing chants the herbs he picked 
on marsian hills will not help his wounds 
umbro how angitias forest and fucinus 
glassy waters and clear lakes will weep for you 
virbius goes to war as well hippolytuss 
handsome son sent by his mother aricia 
he grew up in egerias grove near the 
marshy shores and laden altars of kindly 
diana they say his crafty stepmother murdered 
hippolytus who paid his fathers curse in blood 
torn to pieces by his bolting horses yet he 
was restored to starry skies and breezes reborn 
through the healers herbs and dianas love 
then the mighty father outraged that a human 
should rise from hells shades to the light of life 
plunged the finder of this healing art 
into styxs waters with his lightning bolt 
but kind diana hid hippolytus and sent 
him to the forest of the nymph egeria 
so he could live a humble life in the italian 
woods his name changed to virbius horses 
are forbidden from her temple and her sacred 
groves since they broke both man and chariot 
in their terror at the monster from the sea 
on the plains his son trains highstrung horses as his 
father did and drives a chariot to war 
turnus the most handsome gallops back and forth 
before the line armed and tallest by a head 
his helmet sports a triple plume the chimaeras 
on its crown her jaws breathe etnas fire 
the more the fight flows raw with blood 
the more she roars darkflamed and feral 
his smooth shield sports a giant emblem golden

guards with feronia who loves green groves those who 
hold saturas pitchy marsh and the lowlands 
where the icy ufens plunges in the sea 
to crown the men camilla from the volscians 
a warriorqueen she leads a female cavalry 
like blooms in bronze not for her a womans tasks 
minervas spindle or a basket of wool skeins 
shes steeled for battle and outruns the winds on foot 
shed fly above the topmost tips of uncut stalks 
and not hurt the tender ears when she did 
or run across the sea skimming the high swells 
and not splash her quick feet with the water 
all the young men and a crowd of mothers 
flood from homes and fields in wonder as she goes 
gaping in amazement at the royal purple 
cloaking her smooth shoulders the brooch clasping 
her hair with gold the lycian quiver that she carries 
and the shepherds staff of irontipped myrtle 
book 
as bugles blared their strident notes turnus waved 
the standard on laurentums citadel spurred 
his eager horse and clanged his sword and shield 
at once all hearts were thrown in turmoil in the anxious 
tumult latium swore loyalty the young men 
raged for war messapus mezentius 
the mocker of the gods and ufens led they called in 
conscripts far and wide and stripped the fields of farmers 
venulus was sent to noble diomedes 
to ask for help he told him trojans camped 
in latiumaeneas fleet had docked with his 
defeated gods he claimed he was the fated king 
many tribes had allied with the dardan chief 
his name was heard through latium what he 
meant by these first steps what he wanted out of 
war if fortune favored him was perhaps clearer 
to diomedes than to turnus or latinus 
this was the scene in latium the trojan hero 
knew it all he tossed on a great tide of worry 
his mind flew quickly here and there shifting 
sides weighing all the optionsas quick 
as water shimmers back a trembling light 
when rays of sunshine or the radiant moon 
land on the bronze bowl the beam flutters far 
and wide then angles up and roams the ceiling 
it was night deep sleep held the weary animals 
of all the lands the birds and beasts father 
aeneas heartsick at the threat of war 
lay down on the bank beneath the skys cold 
canopy and finally let himself sleep 
a local god old tiberinus came to him 
rising from his lovely stream among the poplar 
branches he wore flowing graygreen linen 
a crown of reeds shaded his hair he spoke 
and eased aeneas worries with these words 
goddessborn you restore our city troy 
and save her heights from enemies forever 
laurentian lands and latin fields have longed 
for you heres your certain home your household gods 
dont give up or fear the threats of war 
the gods swollen anger is all over 
soonin case you think this dreams a lie 
youll find a giant sow by my banks oaks 
lying there with thirty newborn in her litter 
a white sow resting with white piglets suckling 
by this sign youll know ascanius will found 
famed alba after thirty years roll by 
i foretell the truth now take note heres how 
to bring about whats needed for your victory 
pallas arcadians who followed king 
evander in his war chose to settle here 
they placed their city named pallanteum 
after their ancestor among the hills 
they wage an endless war against the latins 
bring them to your camp and make a treaty 
i myself will guide you there along my banks 
youll outpace the current with your oars 
up then goddessborn when the stars first set 
give juno her due prayers and calm her angry threats 
with humble vows honor me after youve won 
youll see me grazing my banks in full flood 
cutting through the loamy fields skyblue 
tiber the river heaven loves the most my great 
home is here high etrurias my source 
he sank in the deep river plunging to its bed 
night and slumber left aeneas he rose 
and faced the suns glow in the eastern sky 
then ritually cupped riverwater in his hands 
and poured this prayer to the air nymphs 
laurentian nymphs source of all the rivers and you 
father tiberinus with your sacred stream 
accept aeneas and protect him now at last 
pity my ordeals wherever your springs 
rise whatever soil you well from in your glory 
ill always honor you with gifts and worship 
hornd river ruler of hesperias streams 
just stay close and make your omen true 
now he chose two galleys from his fleet 
fitting them with rowers and armed men 
but see a sudden marvel met their eyes 
in the woods they saw a snowy sow 
and her white litter lying on the grassy bank 
pious aeneas killed the sow and piglets 
for great juno and set up an altar 
all that nights full length tiber calmed 
his swell and kept his currents still his surface 
was as level as a pond or placid swamp 
no struggle for the oars going upstream 
as cheers rose they hurried on their journey 
the pitchglazed pine boats smoothly slipped along 
the woods and waters by the banks were dazed to see 
farflashing shields and painted keels in such a place 
the men rowed day and night around long bends 
varied trees cast shade upon the ships that wove 
their way through living woods on silent waters 
when the blazing sun had scaled the heights of sky 
they saw a distant citadel and scattered homes 
romes strength has since raised these to the heavens 
but at that time evanders state was poor indeed 
at once they steered their prows toward the town 
by chance that day arcadias king was making 
annual sacrifice in a forest near the city 
honoring the gods and hercules his son 
pallas other princes and the humble senate 
offered incense with him the altars steamed with gore 
when they saw the tall ships gliding from 
the dusky trees the crews pulling silent oars 
the sudden sight alarmed them they sprang up to leave 
the sacred feast but brave pallas would not let 
the rite be interrupted he grabbed his spear 
ran toward the ships and shouted from a knoll 
men why are you trying these uncharted paths 
what is your race your home where are you heading 
do you bring peace or war from his high stern 
aeneas proffered a sprig of peaceful olive 
you see armed trojans hostile to the latins 
who rudely drove us off though were refugees 
we look for evander take these words to him 
leading dardan chiefs come asking for a treaty 
pallas was struck dumb by troys famous name 
disembark whoever you may be address 
my father face to face come to our home as guests 
he took aeneas hand and clung to it 
as they left the river heading for the grove 
aeneas hailed the king with friendly words 
best of the sons of greece fortune saw fit 
that i appeal to you with olive branches bound 
by holy ribbons the fact that youre arcadian 
a greek chief kin to atreuss sonsthis 
didnt alarm me divine oracles my courage 
our fathers shared blood and your vast fame 
have joined us fate leads with my consent 
that dardanus who sailed to the troad 
was troys first father and her founder he was 
son to atlas child electra so the greeks say 
that massive atlas on whose back the earth 
is balanced now your fathers mercury 
shining maia had him on the snowy peak of 
mount cyllene but tradition tells us atlas 
who holds up the stars was also maias father 
so our two peoples split off from one line 
believing this i refused to send you envoys 
or make some crafty overture i risk my life 
and approach your door as supplicant 
those daunians that hunt you down in war 
hunt us as well believing if they drive us out 
nothing will prevent their taking italy 
their rule will reach both seas that lap her shores 
lets make a pact we trojans have hearts strong 
in battle were brave and our men are tried in war 
evander had been looking at his face 
and eyes scanning all his body he said 
how glad i am to welcome and acknowledge 
the bravest of the trojans how gladly i recall 
the words and voice and face of great anchises 
priam laomedons son visited 
our cold arcadia from salamis 
the kingdom of hesione his sister 
at that time my first beard was mere fuzz 
upon my cheeks i admired the trojan chiefs 
i admired priam but anchises walked 
the tallest of them all i burned with boyish 
longing to speak with the hero to clasp his hand 
i happily escorted him to our city 
pheneus when he left he gave me gifts a lovely 
quiver lycian arrows a cloak of golden weave 
a pair of golden bridles that my pallas has 
well join our hands in treaty as you ask youll go 
home when dawn arrives glad to have my help 
ill offer what i have but now since youve 
come as allies share our celebration 
of these yearly rites we cant postpone them 
and feel at home feasting among friends 
evander ordered that the cleared food and goblets 
be reset he himself seated the guests 
on grassy benches aeneas had the place of honor 
on a maple throne and shaggy lionskin 
men picked to help the altarpriest were quick 
to carry out roast bulls they heaped the baskets 
high with bread ceres hardwon gift and offered 
wine aeneas and the trojans shared the feast 
whole sides of beef and organs vowed to gods 
their hunger gone their appetite now sated 
king evander said no blind superstition 
no ignorance of early gods imposed on us 
the habit of this ritual feast this altar to so 
great a god we were saved trojan guests 
from awful danger for this we renew the rites 
we owe once there was a rocky cliff above us 
now its mass is scattered far and wide the home 
it held is empty its rocks a pile of ruin 
but then it was a vast receding cavern 
in it out of reach of sunny rays lurked 
the horrible halfhuman cacus the caves soil 
steamed constantly with stillwarm slaughter fixed to 
the grim doors hung bloodless rotting heads 
vulcan sired the monster it was vulcans black flames 
that he spewed as he heaved himself around 
at last time brought the help wed hoped a god 
arrived he was the greatest of avengers 
proud of butchering and looting geryons 
triple bulkhercules driving huge bulls 
these cattle crammed the glen and riverbanks 
but cacus mind feral frenzied could leave 
no crime or cunning undared or untried 
he stole from their stabling seven perfect bulls 
seven cows of startling grace to ensure 
their tracks did not face forward the robber dragged them 
by their tails to his cave all signs of their 
route reversed and hid them in the sunless rock 
no one could find tracks that pointed to the cavern 
meanwhile the other cows had grazed their fill 
and hercules was set to leave with all his cattle 
then the herds began to low they filled the glen 
and hills with protest as they noisily departed 
from the giant cave one cow mooed back and 
though imprisoned shattered cacus hopes 
hercules blazed up with anger and black bile 
he grabbed his weapons and his heavy knotted 
club and ran for the hills summit just this 
once we saw cacus afraid terror in his 
eyes he fled back to his cave faster than 
the windit was fear that winged his feet 
and shut himself inside breaking the iron chains 
vulcan had forged to hold a giant boulder 
that hung at the entry it fell and blocked the access 
just then hercules arrived in all his fury 
he scanned the cliff looked here and there 
and gnashed his teeth three times he furiously 
circled the aventine hill and stormed that rocky 
entrance it was no use three times he sank back 
a flinty tower sheer on every side rose up 
from the rooftop of the cave a fitting home 
for stinking vultures nests it leaned to the left 
toward the river grabbing it he jammed it 
hard the other way then tore it from its base 
and hurled it down with force it landed with a crash 
the heavens boomed the water in the stream 
leapt up and fell back on itself in fear 
cacus cavern his huge home appeared 
the dark grotto was laid open to its core 
as if the earth had cracked under some force 
gaping to the heart of hell the pallid lands 
loathed by the gods as if the vast abyss below 
were visible and ghosts trembled at the light 
cacus was caught by the sudden glare and trapped 
inside the hollow rock howling now 
in a new key the heros arrows rained on him 
and any weapons he could find branches and huge 
boulders cacus had to deal with the danger 
he belched a giant smokecloud from his jaws 
amazingly and wrapped his home in inky fog 
stealing it from view from inside his cave 
he spewed out smoky fire mixed with darkness 
hercules lost patience he took a headlong leap 
right through the flames where the smoke seethed 
densely black clouds warping in the heat 
as cacus spouted useless fire into the dark 
the hero grabbed him in a strangling chokehold 
his eyes bulged out and blood drained from his throat 
his pitchblack lair lay open the doors ripped away 
at once the stolen cattle and his lies 
were exposed for all to see the monstrous corpse 
was dragged out by the feet our men could not 
get their fill of looking at its awful eyes 
and face the chest of matted hair his jaws dead flames 
since then grateful generations such as we 
have marked this day potitius established it 
and now the pinari watch over it 
in a forest they set up this altar we call 
greatest it will always be the greatest 
come men wreathe your hair with leaves to praise him 
hold out goblets in your hands call on 
our shared god offer him wine willingly 
he veiled his hair with braided fronds of poplar 
the dappled shady growth of hercules tree 
then took up a sacred goblet all were glad to 
pour wine on the altar and call upon the gods 
meanwhile heaven circled and the sky grew dark 
the priests led by potitius and wearing pelts 
the custom carried torches they resumed the feast 
and brought in welcome offerings for the second course 
heaping up the tables with the loaded plates 
the sali chanted around the lighted altars 
their heads ringed with poplartwo choruses 
one young one old to chant hercules famous deeds 
how he grabbed and throttled with his hand 
snakes sent by his stepmother twin monsters 
how he overthrew outstanding cities troy and 
oechalia and endured a thousand 
tasks set by eurystheus and hostile juno 
unconquered one you killed the cloudborn centaurs 
pholus and hylaeus with bare hands you killed 
the cretan hybrid and the giant nemean lion 
stygian waters trembled and so did orcus guard 
lying on halfeaten bones in his bloodstained 
cave no shape could scare younot even typhoeus 
towering and armed you devised a way 
to kill the hydra as its heads bobbed all around you 
hail true son of jupiter the gods own glory 
be present and support us and your rites 
so they celebrated him in song with cacus 
cave as climax and the halfman breathing fire 
the forests rang with sound the hills echoed it back 
when the rites were over they turned back to town 
the king proceeded slowly burdened by his age 
he kept pallas and aeneas close 
lightening the walk with varied tales 
aeneas admired everything charmed by the site 
he gladly looked at what evander noted asking for 
and hearing of the memories of men of old 
king evander founder of romes stronghold said 
native fauns and nymphs once held these groves 
and a race of men from hardy oaktree trunks 
they had no culture and no customs no notion 
of yoking bulls amassing wealth or storing food 
acorns fed them and huntings harsh livelihood 
saturn was first to come from high olympus 
fleeing war with jupiter an exile with no 
kingdom he united the unruly race 
that was scattered on the mountains gave them laws 
and called it latiumhed safely hidden here 
he was king during the age called golden 
and he ruled the people in unbroken peace 
until a duller and degraded age came in 
mad for war greedy for gain then came 
ausonian mobs and sicanian tribes 
the land of saturn often changed its name 
next came many kings and the cruel giant thybris 
we italians named the river tiber for him 
the ancient name of albula was lost and i 
i was an exile sailing to the ends of ocean 
ineluctable allpowerful fate settled me 
here the dread warnings of my mother the nymph 
carmentis drove me and the god apollos plans 
evander pointed out the altar on their path 
and the carmental gate so the romans call it 
an ancient tribute to the nymph carmentis who sang 
the fates and first foretold the future of aeneas 
noble sons and the famed pallanteum 
he showed the spacious grove used by stern romulus 
as a refuge then in a cliffs cool shade 
the lupercal named for arcadias lycian pan 
he marked out argiletums sacred pasture 
and swore that his guest argus died right here next 
came the tarpeian rock and then the capitol 
golden now rough then with thorny thickets 
even then the eerie godhead of the place 
alarmed the nervous farmers who trembled at the 
woods and rock a god lives in this very grove 
and leafy hill we dont know who our men 
believe they can see jupiter himself shaking 
his black shield in his hand and bringing storms 
you see these two towns their walls in ruins 
theyre whats left of monuments to men of old 
janus founded this stronghold and saturn that 
ones janiculum one saturnia 
with such talk they neared evanders humble home 
herds were everywhere lowing in the forum 
and the grand carinae when they reached 
his house he said triumphant hercules 
came in this door this kings lodging hosted him 
my guest dare to despise wealth be like 
a god yourself dont look down on my poverty 
he led massive aeneas under this narrow roof 
and set him down on bedding the skinned pelt of 
a libyan bear on heapedup stacks of leaves 
night fell wrapping earth with dusky wings 
venus fearful for her son and rightly fretful 
at the latins threats and angry clamor 
now spoke to vulcan in their golden bedroom 
breathing divine love into her words 
dearest husband when greek kings destroyed 
doomed troy and her citadel was falling 
to the flames i didnt seek help for the victims 
i didnt ask for weapons from your skill and strength 
i didnt want your labor to be wasted 
though i owed much to priams sons and often 
wept over aeneas hardships now as jove 
commands hes landed on rutulian shores 
so ive come to beg you after allyou whom 
i adoreto ask for weapons for my son 
the mothers thetis and aurora moved you once 
with tears see how nations mass how cities 
sharpen swords behind locked gates to kill 
my boy as vulcan wavered venus wrapped 
her snowy arms around him in a soft embrace 
at once he felt the wellknown flame it sank 
into his bones and ran along his weakened frame 
just as forked lightning and its flash of light 
tear through dark clouds with a thundering crash 
his wife knew her effect her cunning pleased her 
vulcan bound by his undying love asked her 
why bring up the past goddess wheres your faith 
in me if youd worried then id have justly 
armed the trojans neither fate nor mighty 
jupiter forbade troy and king priam 
to survive for ten more years now too 
if you prepare to fight and your mind is set 
any care i can promise in my art 
whatever can be made with molten iron and 
electrum whatever flames and wind can do 
dont beg dont doubt your power he made love 
to her as he desired then lying draped 
on his wifes breasts he let slumber wind through him 
when a few hours of rest had banished sleep 
he rose it was after midnight when a woman 
forced to use minervas loom to make her living 
rises to add nighttime to her work and pokes 
the dormant embers she calls the slaves to lamplight 
for the lengthy work of cardingall to keep 
her widowed bed untouched and raise the little ones 
as industriously the lord of fire 
left his downy bed to labor at the forge 
an island rises near lipare and the coast 
of sicily its steep crusted in smoking rocks 
beneath it lie the caves of etna eaten hollow 
by the thunderous forges of the cyclopes 
strong blows strike the shrieking anvils in the din 
iron ingots hiss in furnaces with flames 
dancing around them its vulcans home vulcania 
the lord of fire flew here from the sky 
steropes brontes and barearmed pyragmon 
were wielding iron in the massive cave 
they held a roughly hammered thunderbolt 
part polished part unformed the father of the gods 
hurls these endlessly from sky to earth 
theyd soldered on three strikes of twisting hail 
three each of storm red fire and winged south wind 
they added terrifying flashes thunder 
fear and the heat that follows rage 
elsewhere they were busy with mars chariot 
on flying wheels the one he rides to enflame men 
and cities and polished eagerly a ghastly shield 
for angered pallas it had golden serpent scales 
intertwining snakes and at the center 
headless gorgon still too grim to look at 
cyclopes of etna he yelled drop your work 
set aside your projects pay attention 
we must forge weapons for a fierce warrior 
nows the time for strength quick hands and expert skill 
hurry at this they set to work at once 
splitting up the tasks bronze and gold ore 
ran in rivulets wounding chalyb melted 
in a massive furnace they made a giant shield 
to equal all the weapons of the latins welding 
it with seven layers circle upon circle 
some drew in air and pumped it out with puffing bellows 
others tempered hissing bronze in water 
the cave groaned with the anvils weight their arms 
swung in a forceful rhythm up and down 
as they twisted hot ore with their gripping tongs 
while the lord of lemnos urged this work on them 
the gentle light and sunrise song of birds 
called evander from his humble home 
the old man rose wrapped his body in a tunic 
and tied on tuscan sandals he attached a swordbelt 
to his side and took up a tegean shield 
a cloak of panthers hide hung at his left 
two watchdogs went before him crossing the high 
threshold and matched their masters steps the hero 
headed for the sheltered lodging of his guest 
aeneas mindful of his promise to give aid 
aeneas too was up this early with evander 
had come pallas with aeneas achates 
they met clasped hands and sat down in the courtyard 
at last they could have a frank exchange 
king evander started greatest leader 
of the trojans while you live i wont 
admit troys kingdom has collapsed despite 
our fame our resources for war are thin 
tuscan tiber hems us on one side rutulians 
threaten on the other their weapons clang around 
our town but i have allies for you large nations 
and armed camps with many kingdoms fortune gives 
this unexpected aidyour presence must be fated 
not far from here theres a city built of ancient 
stone agylla where the lydians famed 
in battle once settled the tuscan hills 
but this town that flowered many years fell to 
king mezentius cruel and brutal rule 
i wont dwell on this tyrants godless murders 
or barbarity may the gods store it all up 
for him and his he used to yoke the living 
to the dead hand to hand and face to face 
a form of torture so they died a lingering death 
dripping pus and gore within that grim embrace 
at last the citizens sick of this horror took up 
arms and blocked the madman in his home 
they killed his allies and threw torches on his roof 
but in the carnage he escaped to the rutulians 
now hes defended by his ally turnus army 
all etruria has risen up in rightful outrage 
they want the king for punishment or else its war 
aeneas ill make you leader of these thousands 
whose ships are packed along the shore they shout 
for battles start but an ancient seer stops them 
by singing of the fates lydias chosen men 
finest flower of an ancient race righteous 
anger at mezentius drives you to war 
but no italian may guide your great people 
you must await a foreign leader fearing 
the gods warning theyve pitched camp on this plain 
now tarchon sends me envoys with a crown 
and scepter hoping that ill join the camp 
and take the tuscan throne but my old age 
worn out by years cold and sluggish grudges me 
such leadership im too old for daring deeds 
id urge my son but his mother sabellas 
italian and his blood is mixed fate favors 
your age your race and the gods ask for you 
march on bravest chief of trojans and italians 
and ill lend you pallas my hope and comfort 
hell learn to be a soldier and do mars grim 
labor from your leadership let him 
admire you from the start from me hell have 
two hundred horsemen the core of our strength 
and hell bring as many on his own account 
staunch achates and aeneas remained still 
eyes fixed on the ground brooding over 
all their hardships with sad hearts but now 
venus sent a signal from the cloudless sky 
a sudden booming lightning bolt came flashing 
from above the world seemed to reel 
the ring of tuscan trumpets sounded through the air 
as they looked up thunder cracked repeatedly 
where the sky was clear they saw a single cloud 
in it swords appeared to turn bloodred and clash 
the others were astonished but the trojan hero 
knew the thunder of his divine mothers pledge 
my host he said theres no need to ask 
what these signs mean olympus summons me 
my goddess mother said shed send this omen 
if war was imminent and bring vulcans armor 
from the sky to help what carnage is in store 
for the poor laurentians turnus how youll 
pay tiber how many helmets shields and bodies 
of the brave youll tumble in your stream 
let the latins break the treaty and wage war 
aeneas spoke and rose from where he sat 
he lit herculess smoking altars gladly 
honoring the humble housegods as hed done 
the day before evander offered chosen sheep 
as due the trojans did the same afterward 
aeneas went back to his crews still at the ships 
and chose the bravest men to follow him to war 
the others glided downstream on the rivers 
helpful current bringing news of these affairs 
and of his father to ascanius trojans 
bound for tuscan fields were given horses 
for aeneas they brought a special one it wore 
a tawny lion pelt that gleamed with gilded claws 
rumor flew right through the little town at once 
horsemen were riding fast for tuscan lands 
frightened mothers renewed prayers fear grew 
with danger and wars specter now loomed larger 
as pallas left evander clasped his hand clinging 
to his son sobbing inconsolably 
if only jupiter would give me back my youth 
the man i was when i subdued the front lines 
at praeneste and burned great piles of shields 
i sent king erulus to hell by this right hand 
feronia his mother gave him three lives at birth 
dreadful to tell and three sets of armor 
i had to strike him down three times but still 
this hand took those triple lives and triple armor 
then id never be wrenched from your sweet embrace 
my son mezentius would not have put so many 
to the sword insulting me his neighbor 
our town would not be widowed all the time 
o powers above and jupiter great ruler 
of the gods pity this arcadian king i beg 
hear a fathers prayer if fate and your strength 
keep my pallas safe if ill live to see him 
and rejoin him let me live i can endure 
anything but fortune if you threaten 
the unspeakable let me cut off this cruel 
life right now while my worry is still vague 
while theres halting hope for whats to come 
while i hold you dear son my late and only 
joy may no painful news come to these ears 
as he poured this out at their last meeting 
he collapsed the houseslaves carried him inside 
now the cavalry left from the open gates 
aeneas and loyal achates in the lead 
then the other trojan princes among his troops 
pallas stood out in his cloak and ornamented 
armorlike the morning star still wet with oceans 
waves his sacred face rising to dispel darkness 
venus favorite among the fiery stars 
the anxious mothers stood along the walls watching 
the dusty cloud and troops gleaming in bronze 
they rode with weapons through the brush the shortest way 
a shout went up and all fell into line 
their horses pounding hooves crumbled the soil 
there was a grove by cool caeres stream 
held holy far and wide by ageold traditions 
it was ringed all round by hills of somber spruce 
the storys that the old pelasgians the first 
to live in italy vowed it to silvanus 
god of fields and flocks and chose his holy day 
tarchon and the tuscans made camp nearby 
in a safe place from the heights all the legions 
could be seen their tents pitched through the fields 
aeneas joined them with his chosen warriors 
tired they tended to their horses and themselves 
now venus shining goddess came with gifts 
through heavens clouds from afar she saw her son 
in a secluded valley alone by a cold stream 
she appeared to him and spoke these words 
look your gifts perfected by my husbands 
art as promised so my son dont hesitate 
to call to war fierce turnus and the proud 
laurentians she embraced her child and set 
his gleaming weapons by an oak aeneas 
delighted by this honor couldnt get his fill of 
looking at the goddess gifts in awe he scanned 
each detail turning over in his hands 
the helmet pouring out its flamelike crest 
the deadly sword the breastplate stiff with bronze 
massive bloodred like a dark cloud set afire 
by the suns bright rays and blazing in the sky 
the smooth greaves of electrum and forged gold the spear 
and the shields engraving complex beyond words 
the lord of fire who knew of prophecies about 
ages to come had carved on it italys history 
roman triumphs all the generations of 
ascaniuss line and their wars in sequence 
hed carved a shewolf sprawled in mars green grotto 
shed whelped and twin boys played around her teats 
hanging on them suckling on their mother 
without fear she nuzzled them in turn bending 
her soft neck licking their forms into shape 
vulcan set rome nearby and the sabines 
lawlessly abducted from the theater 
at the circus games and a sudden war 
with old tatius and his severe cures 
next the same two kings stood armed before joves 
altar their conflict laid aside holding bowls 
theyd sacrificed a pig to sanctify their peace 
close by chariot teams had charged apart 
dismembering mettus he should have kept his word 
tullus dragged the traitors entrails through the wood 
the thorns were drenched with bloody dew porsenna 
ordered rome to take back banished tarquin 
and ringed the city with a massive siege 
aeneas heirs died on the swords for liberty 
see his lifelike lookmenacing and angry 
because cocles dared to wreck the bridge 
cloelia to break her chains and swim the river 
manlius guarding the tarpeian fort 
the temple and high capitol was at the top 
romuluss roof was bristly with new thatch 
a silver goose flapped in a golden portico 
warning that the gauls were at the gates 
they lurked in the bush about to take the fort 
covered by the dark the gift of inky night 
their flowing hair was gold their clothes were gold 
their striped cloaks gleamed twisted gold circled 
their milky necks in their hands were glinting 
double alpine spears long shields hid their bodies 
hed pounded out the leaping sali and naked 
priests of pan their caps tufted with wool and shields 
fallen from the sky in cushioned carriages 
chaste mothers carried sacred vessels through the town 
far off he placed tartarus and dis high gates 
the wages of wickedness and catiline 
dangling from an overhang fearful of the 
furies the pious were set apart receiving 
catos laws between it all flowed oceans image 
a golden swell with dark blue whitecapped waves 
around the rim silver dolphins swept the surface 
with their tails cutting through the surging sea 
in the center sailed bronze warships they fought 
the sea battle of actium cape leucas its waves 
bright with gold frothed with the armada 
here augustus caesar led all italy 
to war the senate people gods of sky and hearth 
from high on the stern his bright brow poured 
twin flames his fathers comet rose above 
tall agrippa steered the fleet with gods and winds 
behind him he wore a naval crown on it gleamed 
bright images of prows a martial honor 
antony was opposite with asian wealth 
and hodgepodge troops victor over eastern hordes 
and the red sea he brought egypt eastern might 
distant bactraand for shame a wife from egypt 
the forces smashed together and the whole sea frothed 
torn by oars and threespiked beaks of boats 
the crews made for the open massive ships rammed towering 
sternsyoud think the cyclades torn up were free 
to roam the waters or that mountains smashed together 
flaming flax and flying spears rained from their hands 
and justspilled blood turned neptunes fields red 
in the thick of it the queen called to her fleet 
with her native rattlenot seeing the pair of snakes 
behind her monstrous mongrel gods and barking 
anubis turned weapons against venus neptune 
and minerva iron mars was in their midst mad 
for battle awful furies swooped in from the sky 
and discord in her tattered cloak joined gladly 
bellona followed with her bloody whip 
apollo saw this from his shrine and aimed his bow 
at that every indian and egyptian 
every arab and sabaean cut and ran 
the queen herself was calling to the winds 
loosening the lanyards in flight under full sail 
the lord of fire made her pale with future death 
swept by waves and wind amid the sea of blood 
opposite hed carved the mighty nile in mourning 
opening his garments folds welcoming 
the conquered to his bluegreen bays and hidden streams 
but caesar rode to rome in triple triumph and made 
the gods of italy an immortal vow 
three hundred spacious shrines across the city 
the roads rang with joy applause and revelry 
bands of women were at every shrine and altar 
where slaughtered calves covered the ground he himself 
seated by the snowy marble temple of bright 
apollo reviewed the nations gifts to be fastened 
on proud doorposts a long row of conquered tribes 
filed by distinct in clothes weapons and languages 
vulcan had forged nomads looserobed africans

morini and the twohorned rhine the untamed 
dahae and araxes upset at his bridge 
aeneas admires vulcans shield his mothers gift 
pleased by images he does not understand 
he hoists the fame and fate of his descendants 
book 
while these events unfolded far away juno 
saturns daughter sent iris from the sky to find 
bold turnus by chance he was sitting in a sacred 
valley in his ancestor pilumnus woods 
iris child of thaumas spoke to him from rosy 
lips turnus times orbit brings you freely what 
no god would dare to promise aeneas leaves 
his camp his fleet and troops making for 
evanders palace on the palatine 
then farther still all the way to distant towns 
in corythus to arm a band of lydian farmers 
dont wait nows the time to call for horse and 
chariot surprise their camp and storm it 
with this she rose into the sky on level wings 
drawing a huge arc beneath the clouds 
turnus knew her he stretched up his hands 
following her flight with words iris heavens 
glory who sent you to me from the clouds 
theres a sudden glimmer in the air the sky 
divides to show the circling constellations 
ill follow this great omen no matter who 
calls me to war he approached the stream 
and drank from its clear surface then begged the gods 
at length his prayers piling in the sky 
all the army now marched on the open fields 
rich in horsemen sumptuous garb and gold 
messapus rallied the front lines tyrrhus sons 
the rear turnus led the columns center 
they moved like the silent swell of the deep ganges 
fed by seven gentle streams like the niles 
lifegiving water when it overflows then ebbs 
suddenly the trojans saw a dusty black cloud 
taking shape darkness shadowing the plain 
from the ramparts caius was the first to shout 
whats that swirling globe of dirt and dust 
quick bring swords and spears man the walls 
the enemys upon us clattering they 
retreated through the gates and crammed into the camp 
this was the mighty warrior aeneas order 
as he left in case of crisis they shouldnt dare 
to draw up ranks or trust to open battle 
but guard the camp within the safety of the walls 
so though shame and rage called them to fight 
they blocked the gates and followed orders armed 
inside the towers waiting for the enemy 
turnus took twenty from the cavalry and rode 
ahead his horse a snowy dappled thracian his helmet 
gold and crimsoncrested the army followed him 
he caught the camp unready men he cried 
who comes with me whos first to charge the enemy 
he hurled his spear through the air an overture 
to war and raced across the plain his men 
took up his shout and followed with a curdling cry 
they marveled at the trojans coward heartshow they 
shunned the battle on the field and sat snug 
in their camp turnus frantic for an entrance 
rode back and forth to scan the walls nothing 
as a wolf prowls around a crowded sheepfold 
howling by its gate pelted in the dark 
by wind and rain while ewes keep safe the lambs 
bleating beneath them beside himself the wolf 
is mad for what he cannot have exhausted 
by long famine his dry jaws parched for blood 
just so turnus anger flared up as he probed 
the walls and camp rage burned in his bones 
how could he find an entrance how shake out 
the nesting trojans and spill them on the plain 
their fleet was anchored near the camp guarded 
on each side by earthworks and the river 
he called for fire from his cheering friends 
took up a flaming brand and stormed the ships 
his men leapt to work spurred by turnus presence 
all took up lit torches looted from the fires 
the pitchsmeared pine produced a sooty light 
and vulcan wafted sparks and ashes to the stars 
what god o muses repelled the hungry blaze 
who kept the fire from the fleet tell me 
ancient times trusted this tale its fame lives on 
when aeneas first built his fleet on phrygian ida 
to sail the oceans depths cybele so they say 
mother of the gods addressed great jupiter 
my son since youve tamed olympus grant 
this favor that your loving mother asks 
on a mountain summit was a grove i loved 
for many years where people brought me offerings 
pitchpine trees and maples lent it murky shade 
i gave it to aeneas when he needed ships 
and gladly so but fear makes me anxious now 
comfort me and grant your mothers prayer dont let 
the boats be swamped at sea by waves or whirlwinds 
let it help them that my mountain was their home 
her son who spins the constellations said mother 
how would you bend fate what is this hope 
should boats produced by mortal hands enjoy 
immortal rights should aeneas confront danger 
without danger what god has such power 
but when their task is done when theyve reached the ports 
of italy ill take away the earthly form 
of the boats who brought trojan aeneas 
to laurentian fields and make them ocean 
goddesses like doto the nered 
or galatea fronting seafoam as they swim 
he swore this by his stygian brothers streams 
the banks that boil with pitch the black abyss 
shaking all olympus with his nod 
the promised day had come and the fates discharged 
the debt of time turnus onslaught cued the mother 
to keep the sacred fleet safe from the fire 
first a strange light blazed before their eyes 
from the east a huge cloud carrying the goddess 
worshippers traversed the heavens then a dreadful 
voice boomed down and deafened both the armies 
trojans dont be anxious to defend my ships 
or fight turnus cant burn down my sacred fleet 
any more than burn the waves goddesses 
go freely your mother commands you at once 
the boats broke off their moorings from the bank 
and dived down to the depths plunging in beakfirst 
as dolphins do then a miracle to tell 
nymphs in equal numbers rose to ride the waves 
the rutulians were stunned the horses reared 
even messapus felt fear the tiber slowed 
its raucous course then retreated from the sea 
yet this barely touched bold turnus confidence 
instead he raised their spiritsand added a rebuke 
these omens target trojans jove himself 
held back his usual help from themwe didnt 
need to torch the boats now these men cant cross 
the sea and theres nowhere to run half the world 
is out of reach we control this land and countless 
weapons arm the tribes of italy the gods signs 
that the trojans boast of scare me not at all 
the fates and venus have their due phrygians reached 
the fertile soil of italy and heres my fate 
to extirpate this evil race who stole my wife 
that pain doesnt only touch the sons of 
atreus just wars are fought by others too 
its enough that troy fell once that they stole once 
should be enough youd think theyd shun 
all women now their barricades and ditches 
give them heartsmall delays before their death 
didnt they see the walls of troy collapse in flames 
those were built by neptunes hand my chosen band 
whos prepared to follow me to wreck the ramparts 
with his sword and storm the quaking camp 
i dont need vulcans armor or a thousand ships 
to fight the teucrians all tuscany can join them 
no need for them to fear the night cowards 
stealing the palladium murdered sentries 
on the heights or a horses hidden womb 
well ring their walls with fire in the light of day 
ill make sure they realize theyre not facing 
the greek soldiers hector held off for ten years 
but now the better part of day is done 
rest yourselves for what remains be happy 
with a job well done and expect a fight 
messapus was told to block the gates with 
sentries and set watchfires round the walls 
rutulians were picked to guard the camp 
fourteen of them each led a hundred men 
purpleplumed and bright with golden armor 
they dispersed taking up the watch in turn 
or sprawling on the grass enjoying wine 
tilting back bronze winebowls the fires twinkled 
as the sentries passed the sleepless night in games 
the trojans watched this from the ramparts on guard 
with their weapons worrying they checked 
the gates built high gangways linking towers 
and stockpiled spears fierce serestus and mnestheus 
spurred them on these two were aeneas choice 
as the soldiers leaders their strategists in crisis 
the whole force on the walls shared in the risks 
of nightwatch each man at a post assigned by lot 
nisus fearless in a fight guarded the gate 
hyrtacus son quick with lances and light arrows 
whom the huntress ida sent to serve aeneas 
his friend was euryalus among the troops 
there was no warrior more handsomea boy 
whose unshaved chin showed pubertys first fuzz 
they shared one mind one heart they rushed to battle 
side by side now they shared watch at the gate 
nisus asked do gods enflame our hearts 
euryalus or do our fierce desires become 
our gods im not content with idleness 
ive long been keen to fight to do something 
heroic you see how cocksure these rutulians are 
their fires are far apart and theyre sprawled around 
slack with wine and sleep alls quiet so hear 
what ive been wondering how my thoughts are taking shape 
the leaders and the army want to send news 
to aeneas and recall him to the camp 
if they give you my reward the glory of 
the exploit is enough for me i think i see 
a path along that hill to pallanteums walls 
euryalus was stunned a deep desire struck him 
to win fame too and he asked his fervent friend 
nisus im not included in this crucial mission 
im supposed to send you into danger all 
alone thats not how my father taught mewarsteeled 
opheltes who raised me during the greek horror 
and troys hardships thats not how ive acted 
at your side risking death for great aeneas 
i scorn the light of day to me this fame you want 
is a bargain at the cost of losing life 
nisus said i hardly feared you were a coward 
the thought i swear it by my hopes that jove 
or any god whos just brings me back a victor 
but if as often happens in this sort of plan 
some god or chance puts me in jeopardy 
i want you to survive youre young you deserve 
to live if my bodys rescued or else ransomed 
i need you to bury me if fortune wont 
allow that gift my absence with a tomb 
and funeral i dont want to bring such grief 
to your poor mother the only one of all of them 
who dared to follow you and leave acestes town 
euryalus said you can grope for reasons 
theres no point i wont change my mind 
lets go he roused some guards to take their place 
and keep the watch in turn then left his post 
heading off with nisus to locate their king 
all the other living things throughout the land 
were giving up their cares to sleep their hearts 
at rest from trouble but a chosen set 
of trojan leaders were conferring on the crisis 
what to do who should take a message to 
aeneas they stood in the middle of the camp 
leaning on long spears gripping shields 
both nisus and euryalus begged urgently 
to be admitted at once on a crucial matter 
worth the time ilus let the eager pair 
join in and told nisus to speak hyrtacus 
son began aeneas generals hear us fairly 
dont judge our offer by our age the rutulians 
are silent slack with wine and sleep weve found 
a place to bypass them a spot to sneak through 
by the gate thats closest to the sea 
some sentry fires are out others sputter 
smokily if youll let us take this chance 
to reach aeneas in pallanteum well be 
back here soon with spoils from many dead 
we wont get lost weve often hunted in the 
dark dells near the city and we know the river 
at this aletes bent with years but wise of mind 
said gods of troy whose power guards us always 
you dont intend to ruin the trojans after all 
such brave young men youve given us such steadfast 
hearts tears streaming down his face 
he clasped their shoulders and right hands what gifts 
you two what presents could be worthy of your 
bravery the gods and your own conduct 
will grant the first and finest one pious aeneas 
will swiftly give the rest as will ascanius 
still so young wholl recall this all his life 
ascanius broke in in fact i beg you both 
since im only safe if fathers back 
by our great housegods assaracus lar 
and whitehaired vestas shrine i place my life 
my trust in you bring back my father set him 
in my sight once hes here all will be well 
ill give you double goblets chased in silver 
that my father took after arisbas fall 
two tripods two large golden ingots and an antique 
bowl sidonian dido gave to me 
if we seize the soil and scepter of this land 
when i give out spoils by lot ill put aside 
the horse that turnus rode and his golden armor 
you saw them nisusto be yours your prize 
that horse the shield and turnus crimson plumes 
father will include twelve slavegirls chosen 
for their beauty and male captives with their weapons 
and more all the land that king latinus owns 
euryalus amazing boy your age is nearer 
to mine i take you as my friend with all my heart 
to come with me no matter what i face 
ill never look for glory in your absence 
in peace and war in words and deeds youre the one 
ill trust the most euryalus replied 
no day will see me falling short of todays daring 
as long as fortune smiles on us but besides 
these many gifts i ask one thing i have a mother 
from priams ancient race poor thing neither troy 
nor king acestes town kept her from coming 
with me i havent told her of my mission 
which may be dangerous nor have i said goodbye 
becausei swear by night and your right hand 
i couldnt bear to see her tears i beg you 
help her in her need and loneliness 
let me take this hope with me and ill go 
still more bravely into danger this moved 
the dardans and they wept handsome ilus 
above all the image of this filial love 
tore at his heart he responded ill do 
everything your great feat earns for you 
shell be a mother to meonly the name creusa 
will be lacking no small thanks await her 
for raising such a son whatever happens i swear 
by my own life as my father used to do 
the gifts i promise if your mission turns out well 
those will still go to your mothers family 
in tears he untied his gilded sword 
and ivory scabbard lycaon of knossos 
forged it long ago with wondrous skill 
mnestheus gave a lionskin torn from 
a shaggy beast loyal aletes traded helmets 
they armed and left at once the group of leaders 
young and old saw them to the gate 
handsome ilus too mature before his years 
and with a grown mans cares gave them many 
mandates for his father but the breezes 
dispersed his words into the clouds unheard 
they crossed the trenches to the fatal camp 
in dark of night bringing death to many 
on the way they saw bodies everywhere 
sprawled throughout the grass in drunken sleep 
chariots propped up on the shore men lying 
among the wheels and harnesses wine goblets 
and weapons hyrtacus son spoke first 
euryalus its time to strike the moments here 
and sos our path keep watch against an ambush 
from the rear be careful look around you 
ill make this camp a graveyard and clear us a wide swath 
then he fell silent with his sword he crept 
toward proud rhamnes who by chance was sleeping 
on a layered heap of rugs and snoring loudly 
he was a king and augur loved by turnus but his 
skill did not prevent his death near him nisus 
killed three slaves who rashly slept among the weapons 
then remus armorbearer and charioteer slashing 
their drooping necks as they slept under their horses 
next he struck away their masters head leaving 
his body sobbing blood warm gore soaked the earth 
and bedding he killed lamyrus and lamus 
then youthful serranus famous for his looks 
whod played cards until the early hours then 
succumbed to winehappier if hed only 
played all night and carried on to dawn 
he was like a starving lion bringing chaos 
to a sheepfold when mindless hunger makes him tear 
the soft sheep mute with fear he roars with bloody jaws 
euryalus matched nisus killing on fire himself 
he mowed down the rank and file before him 
abaris fadus and herbesusall unaware 
but rhoetus was awake and saw it all 
terrified he crouched behind a giant winejar 
as he tried to rise euryalus drove in 
his sword and took it back dripping with death 
rhoetus crimson life pumped out a mix of blood 
and wine the trojan pressed on eagerly 
messapus allies his next target he saw 
the outer fires dead and tethered horses cropping 
grass but nisus sensed his friend was lost 
to lust for slaughter he said briefly lets go dawn 
no friend of ours is near enough revenge 
weve hacked a passage through the enemy 
they left behind many solid silver weapons 
also bowls and gorgeous rugs euryalus 
took rhamnes breastplate and goldstudded swordbelt 
gifts that rich king caedicus once sent to 
remulus of tibur his distant guestfriend 
in death remulus bequeathed them to his grandson 
with his death the rutulians took his warspoils 
euryalus put these on his sturdy shoulders 
they wouldnt save him with messapus strong helmet 
and fine crest they left the camp making for safety 
just now horsemen chanced to come from latium 
volcens led three hundred armed with shields 
they were bringing turnus a response 
while the army waited drawn up in the fields 
as they neared the camps defenses they saw 
these two veering left far off in the predawn 
gloom euryalus helmet mirrored 
the moons rays and betrayed the thoughtless boy 
taking note volcens shouted from the ranks 
halt why are you on the road why armed 
where are you going the two made no reply 
but ran still faster to the woods trusting to 
the dark the horsemen blocked the roadsthey knew 
them welland set guards at the exits the woods 
bristled far and wide with thickets and black 
holmoaks dense brambles clustered all around 
a narrow passage glimmered through the shrouded paths 
the forests darkness and his heavy plunder slowed 
euryalus and his fear misled him 
but nisus had escaped the troops in a blind rush 
past a spot later called alban after alba 
where latinus had his stables he stopped then 
looking for his missing friend in vain 
poor euryalus where did i lose you which way 
should i go he traced back every winding trail 
of that tricky forest looking for his tracks 
wandering through the silent brush he heard 
horses and a hubbub proof of the pursuers 
it wasnt long till shouting reached his ears 
and he saw euryalus tricked by night 
and forest and the sudden skirmish struggling wildly 
as the troop of horsemen dragged him off 
what should he do how could he save the boy 
should he throw himself at them though doomed 
and die a noble death among their swords 
quickly he drew back his arm to hurl his spear 
looking up at the high moon and praying 
you goddess latonas daughter glory 
of the stars and guardian of the woods help me 
in my trouble if my father brought your altars 
gifts from me if i offered wild game from 
my hunts and hung them from your dome and sacred roof 
guide my spear let me break apart their band 
he hurled his weapon using all his strength 
the flying shaft severed nights shadow 
it struck sulmos back and snapped piercing 
his heart with shattered wood he slumped to earth 
warm streams pumped from his chest and long convulsions 
shook him he grew cold the group stared round 
nisus fiercer still wielded a new spear 
by his ear he hurled the hissing weapon 
at the panicked men it went through tagus temples 
sticking there warming in his punctured brain 
savage volcens raged but couldnt see who threw 
the spear nor where to aim his furious attack 
instead he turned his bare blade on euryalus 
and said you will pay me with hot blood 
for both my men at this nisus insane 
with terror no longer hiding in the dark unable 
to endure such pain called out its me 
me rutulians i did it turn your swords 
on me i attacked you he didnt couldnt 
dare it i swear by the sky and knowing stars 
he just loved his wretched friend too much 
but as he spoke the sword plunged violently 
through euryalus ribs ripping open 
his white chest he crumpled dying blood 
ran down his lovely body his neck slumped 
like a purple flower cut down by a plow 
bending as it dies like a poppys drooping 
neck when heavy rain drags down its head 
nisus rushed at them but among them all 
he aimed for volcens only took time for him alone 
the soldiers crowded him jabbing with spears 
to drive him off he fought on still his sword 
swung round like lightning till he shoved it into 
volcens shouting face he killed him and died 
pierced through and through flinging himself 
on his friends corpse finding peace at last in death 
lucky pair if my song has any power 
no day will steal you from times memory while 
aeneas people settle by the capitols 
unmoving stone and a roman father rules 
the rutulian victors took up their spoils 
in tears they carried volcens body back to camp 
their grief was not reduced by bloodless rhamnes 
near the tents by serranus numa and 
so many leaders killed together they rushed 
as one to the dead and dying men the ground 
was warm with gore and streams of foaming blood 
the spoils were recognized messapus gleaming helmet 
and his breastplates emblems rewon with so much sweat 
dawn was sprinkling new light on the lands 
rising early from tithonus saffron bed 
as sunlight soaked the world and laid it bare 
turnus armed himself and roused his men to fight 
each chief marshaled his bronzearmored ranks 
for war whetting their rage with varied rumors 
they stuck the heads of nisus and euryalus 
on pikes held high heartrending to see 
and marched behind them with loud battlecries 
aeneas hardened men stationed their front lines 
to the ramparts left the right side touched the river 
guarding the deep ditches or sadly manning 
the high turretsheartsick at the impaled heads 
oozing with black blood of men they knew so well 
winged rumor flew across the anxious camp 
and stole into the ears of the dead boys mother 
at once warmth left her bones poor thing the shuttle 
tumbled from her hands its wool unwinding 
she leapt up in agony and tore her hair 
shrilling in a womans grief madly running 
for the ramparts and front guard forgetting soldiers 
spears and danger pouring pain into the sky 
is this you euryalus is this the comfort 
kept for my old age my cruel son you left me 
sent off to such danger you didnt pause to say 
goodbye to your unhappy mother now youre dead 
carrion for latin dogs and birds 
in a foreign land i cant take your body 
to the pyre close your eyes and wash your wounds 
or warm you with the robe id woven day and night 
racing time the shuttle soothing my old years 
where can i go what place has your severed 
mangled corpse this head is all youve left me 
son this is what i followed over land and 
sea rutulians show your piety 
throw your weapons at me kill me first 
or you great father of the gods take pity 
use your bolt to plunge my hateful soul to hades 
if thats the only way this bitter life can end 
they were stricken at her cries a sad groan ran 
through all of them their strength for battle drained 
she was stirring too much grief ilioneus 
and weeping ilus ordered actor and idaeus 
to carry her inside and lay her down 
the trumpet blared its terrible bronze notes 
from far a shout went up the heavens bellowed back 
the volscians raced up under overlapping shields 
keen to fill the ditches and tear down the walls 
some tried to breach the camp leaning ladders on the 
walls where the ranks were thin where the ring 
of soldiers showed a gap but long war had taught 
the trojans how to defend walls they rained down 
varied missiles dislodging men with sturdy pikes 
rolling rocks of deadly weight eager to break 
through to the protected ranks the latins huddling 
under their locked shields took pleasure in their safety 
but this was not enough since the trojans dropped 
a giant boulder where the hostile throng 
was thickest it sent rutulians flying far and wide 
breaking their roof of shields the bold rutulians 
had no wish to keep on fighting blindly 
instead they tried to clear the walls by hurling spears 
elsewhere grim to see mezentius brandished 
torches made of tuscan pine hurling smoky fire 
while neptunes son messapus the horsetamer 
tore at the defenses and demanded ladders 
calliope i pray you and your sisters inspire 
me to sing of all the carnage there the deaths 
dispensed by turnus the killers and the victims 
unroll with me the length and breadth of war 
a turret with high gangways towered near 
the camp a vital spot which the italians 
tried with all their strength to storm and topple 
the trojans fought to save it crowding by 
the open oylets to fling stones and spears 
turnus was the first to hurl a burning torch 
the flame clung to the wall fanned by wind 
it consumed the planks and climbed the beams 
inside chaos and terror soldiers frantic to get 
out were trapped they retreated in a huddle 
to the safer side suddenly the tower 
caved under their weight the sky roared with the crash 
halfdead men rained down and the huge fort followed 
impaling them with weapons and hard timbers 
only helenor and lycus made it out 
helenor was in the prime of life a bastard 
son the lydian king had sired on a slave 
licymnia although it was forbidden he fought 
in battle with just a sword and unmarked shield 
when he found himself among turnuss 
thousands the latin legions all around 
he was like a wild beast closeringed by hunters 
raging at their weapons courting death 
on purpose leaping onto their tall spears 
just so about to die he flung himself 
where he saw the hostile speartips thickest 
swift lycus sprinted through the swords and men 
and reached the walls he scrabbled for the top 
stretching up to grasp his comrades hands 
but turnus had kept up armed and right behind him 
catching him he chided fool you thought 
you could escape my grasp he seized him as he dangled 
and pulled a huge chunk of the wall away with him 
like joves lightningcarrier the eagle who grabs 
a hare or snowy swan in his hooks then soars 
or like a wolf mars beast stealing a lamb 
out of the fold as its mother searches bleating 
the latins charged with warcries they filled the ditches 
and flung flaming torches on the roofs 
with a giant rock ileoneus killed 
lucetius as he neared the gate with firebrands 
liger good with lances killed emathion 
asilas arrow unseen brought down coryneus 
from afar turnus slaughtered caeneus whod killed 
ortygius itys dioxippus 
clonius promolus sagaris 
and idas on the turret capys killed privernus 
whom themillas spear had grazedthe fool dropped his 
shield to clutch his wound the gliding arrow pierced him 
on the left and tunneled deep tearing 
the pathways of his breath a lethal wound 
arcens son was close in striking armor 
and an embroidered cloak bright with spanish red 
a handsome boy sent by his father who had 
raised him in mars grove near symaethus streams 
where palicus has altars with rich offerings 
mezentius threw down his spears whirled a hissing 
sling three times around his head and threw 
he split open the boys forehead with hot 
lead and sprawled him on a sandbank dead 
its said this was the first time that ascanius 
let arrows fly in war before hed only scared 
the skittish wild beasts his strong hand killed 
numanus remulus now turnus kin 
hed married turnus younger sister this man strode 
in front of the battleline shouting abuse 
not all fit to tell swollen up with 
his new kingdom strutting his bulk around 
twicebeaten phrygians youre not ashamed to hide 
behind ramparts again delaying death with walls 
see these types whod seize our wives in war 
what god what lunacy drove you to italy 
there are no sons of atreus here no lying 
ulysses were a flinty race we take our newborns 
to the streams and steel them in the icy water 
our sons stay up to hunt wearing out the woods 
their play is breaking colts and shooting arrows 
our men dont tire of work they live off little 
they tame the earth with hoes they humble towns in war 
spears shape our liveswe use their butts 
to drive our oxen slow old age cant sap 
our bravery nor mute our vigor we hide 
our gray hair with a helmet and never stop 
collecting spoils to live on but you your clothes 
have violet and saffron stitching your hobbys 
laziness you love to dance your tunics 
have long sleeves and your hats are bonnets 
o phrygian ladies no men here go prance over 
mount dindymas ridge where the double flute plays 
your sort of tunes your tambourines and mother idas 
boxwoods call you leave the weapons to real men 
ascanius had had enough of this mans boasts 
and threats he pulled his horsehair bowstring 
to its tautest point and stood aiming his arrow 
beseeching jupiter with many prayers 
almighty jove approve my daring act 
ill bring offerings to your temple every year 
and ill set a snowy calf before your altar 
hell hold his gilded forehead as high as his mothers 
butting with his horns and pawing at the sand 
the father heard he thundered on the left 
in the cloudless sky the deadly bowstring twanged 
a taut arrow sprang out hissing horribly 
and pierced remuluss head driving through 
the hollow temples with its iron ascanius 
said curtly now use haughty words to mock our courage 
heres how twicebeaten phrygians answer you 
the trojans shouted gladly their spirits soared skyhigh 
it happened that longhaired apollo seated on 
a lofty cloud was watching the italian army 
and the camp he said to the victor ilus 
bravo my son your first brave deed the pathway 
to the stars born of gods youll father gods 
under assaracus race all wars will cease 
its fated troy will be eclipsed he sprang down 
from the heights of heaven parting airy winds 
and found ascanius first he took on aged 
butes face a man whod been the armorbearer 
for anchises long ago a trusty guard 
aeneas gave him as a tutor to his son 
apollo mirrored the old man in every way 
his voice and color white hair jangling armor 
he said to ilus who was hot for battle 
its enough aeneas son that you shot 
numanus with impunity great apollo 
grants you this first glory hes not jealous 
that you too use a bow but avoid the rest 
of battle he spoke and shed his human form 
slipping from their mortal eyes into thin air 
the trojan leaders knew the god and his immortal 
weapons they heard his quiver clatter as he flew 
at apollos words and will they restrained 
ascanius who hungered for the fight the rest 
returned to battle and the open risk of death 
the clamor rang along the walls and towers 
as they drew their bows and whirled their slings 
all the ground was strewn with spears their shields 
and hollow helmets clashed and clanged the fighting 
surged like rain out of the west lashing earth 
when watery auriga rises like a storm 
that pelts thick hail into the waves when south winds 
freeze the rain and burst the hollow clouds 
pandarus and bitias alcanors sons 
whom the nymph iaera reared in joves groves 
men tall as pinetrees on their native hills 
threw open the gate they guarded trusting 
to their swords inviting in the enemy 
they stood like towers to the right and left 
armed in iron high plumes rippling on their heads 
like twin oaks soaring to the sky by clear waters 
on pos banks or near pleasant athesis 
raising their unshorn heads to heaven the tall 
crowns bob up and down the rutulians 
saw the open gates and charged at once 
but their menled by quercens and 
aquiculus handsome in his armor reckless 
tmarus and haemon son of marsall died 
at the very gates or turned to run 
now rage surged in both sides hating hearts 
the trojans massed together daring combat 
hand to hand and sallying beyond the gate 
as he rampaged elsewhere causing chaos turnus 
heard the news a fever for fresh slaughter gripped 
the enemy theyd put their open gates on show 
he stopped what hed begun wild rage drove him 
to the gates where the proud brothers stood 
first he speared antiphates fighting at 
the front sarpedons bastard by a theban 
mother the shaft of native cornel flew through 
the thin air and speared him in the stomach 
just under his chest the gaping hole spewed out 
a bloody froth the iron grew warm inside his lung 
then turnus slaughtered erymas and merops 
and aphidnus bitias died next roaring 
his eyes blazing but not by a spear hed never 
die by spear a shrieking saguntine pike 
sped his way like lightning the shield of two bullshides 
the trusty breastplate with its double golden scales 
couldnt block it his huge body crumpled falling 
to the groaning earth the giant shield crashed 
above himlike the shore at baiae when 
a pier of giant rocks collapses in the sea 
crashing in a pile of wreckage as it hits 
the shallow bottom making the sea churn black sand 
swirls up and nearby islands tremble at the sound 
soaring prochtya and inarime a hard bed 
piled on typhoeus by jupiters command 
now mars lord of war gave strength and courage 
to the latins twisting his sharp spurs inside 
their chests dealing flight and black fear to the trojans 
latins swarmed from all around to seize 
their chance the god of battle goaded them 
pandarus saw his brothers corpse saw how 
their fortune stood how disaster drove the day 
he pushed against the gate with massive shoulders 
and strained to turn it on its hinges stranding many 
of his men beyond the walls in bitter war 
the rest he shut in with him as they bolted through 
the fool who didnt realize the rutulian king 
was in the crowd and locked him in the city 
like a hulking tiger among helpless sheep 
fresh fire flashed in turnus eyes and his weapons 
rang out horribly his helmets bloodred plumes shook 
lightning glimmered from his shield shocked 
aeneas men saw suddenly that hated face 
that massive frame huge pandarus leapt in front 
boiling with rage at his brothers death he shouted 
this is not your promised dowry queen amatas 
palace these are not the coddling walls of your 
town ardea its a hostile campyoure trapped 
turnus smiled at him and answered calmly come then 
if your heart has any courage fight with me 
tell priam you found achilles here too 
pandarus threw his spear rough with whorls 
and bark with all his strength but the breezes took it 
and saturnian juno bent away the wound 
it brought the shaft stuck in the gate and turnus cried 
you wont escape this weapon nor the power thats 
behind it the man who throws it gives no second chances 
rearing high he raised his sword and halved pandarus 
head right down the center with the blade the temples 
and smooth cheeks were sliced in two a monstrous wound 
with a thud that massive weight crashed to the ground 
in death he spilled onto the dirt his fallen body 
and the armor dripping brains his head 
split down the middle hung over each shoulder 
terrified the trojans turned and scattered 
and if the victor had thought then to smash 
the locks and let his allies in that would 
have been the end of warand of the trojans 
but frenzy and an insane lust for slaughter drove him 
blazing at his enemies phaleris 
was killed gyges hamstrings cut he seized 
spears and hurled them at the fleeing trojans 
juno gave him bravery and strength then sent 
halys to the dead then phegeus his shield 
pierced then halius alcander nomon 
and prytanis caught off guard as they cheered 
men from the walls lynceus attacked calling 
on his friends but by the righthand rampart turnus 
slashed him first one strike of his flashing sword 
his severed head and helmet landed far away 
next fell amycus slayer of beasts best at 
smearing arrowtips and arming spears with poison 
and clytius aeolus son and cretheus 
the muses friend and follower who always loved 
the lyre and songs and setting verse to music 
he always sang of horses war battles and men 
at last the trojan leaders heard news of the bloodbath 
fierce serestus and mnestheus both ran up 
to see the trojans scattered the enemy inside 
mnestheus shouted are you running but where to 
what other walls or camps do you have citizens 
will a single man fenced in by your ramparts 
deal death through our quarters unopposed 
and send the best of our young men to orcus 
cowards wheres your shame and pity for your 
suffering land your ancient gods and great aeneas 
these words fired them with courage they joined up 
to hold the line meanwhile turnus edged back from 
the fighting aiming for a spot next to the river 
now the trojans fell on him more fiercely 
massing round him with loud yellslike a band 
of hunters cornering a savage lion with spears 
hes afraid but hate is in his eyes as he 
retreats rage and nerve wont let him turn his back 
he longs to spring but balks at men and weapons 
so turnus fell back slowly hesitating 
his mind seething with rage twice he charged 
into their ranks disrupting them and pushed 
the trojans back against the walls but they 
quickly regrouped from the borders of the camp 
juno saturns daughter didnt dare supply him 
strength since jupiter had sent down iris 
from the sky to pass on his harsh threats 
if turnus didnt leave the trojan camp 
the fighter couldnt hold his ground with shield 
or sword the spears heaped on him from every side 
engulfed him and his helmet rang around his head 
with constant clangs flying stones had broken its hard 
bronze and the crest had been knocked off his shield 
couldnt stop the blows now thundering mnestheus 
and the trojan soldiers multiplied the rain 
of spears his whole body ran with grimy streams 
of sweat he couldnt breathe and shook with gasps 
at last he leapt into the river plunging in 
headfirst with his armor its sandy currents welcomed 
him and buoyed him with gentle waves rinsing 
off the blood it sent him happy to his friends 
book 
now great olympus palace was flung open 
the father of the gods and king of men convened 
a council in that starry home from whose heights 
he saw all lands the trojan camps and latin peoples 
when all were seated in the hall with double doors 
he began great skygods why this change 
of heart this bitter disagreement my command 
was that the trojans and italians should not fight 
whats this conflict then what fear caused 
each side to take to war and weapons the time 
for fighting will arrive dont hasten it 
when fierce carthage opens up the alps 
to launch destruction on romes citadel 
then they can compete in hate and pillage 
for now stop be allies gladly as agreed 
jupiter spoke briefly but golden venuss 
response was far from brief father eternal 
king of mankind and the world entire 
who else could i appeal to now dont you see 
how proudly the rutulians strut how boldly 
turnus gallops through the ranks puffed up by 
fresh victory the trojan camp no longer 
offers safety the fights within the very walls 
and ramparts the trenches overflow with blood 
aeneas is away and doesnt know will you 
never let the siege be raised again 
an army menaces the walls of a new troy 
again diomedes will attack the trojans 
from greek arpi no doubt new wounds await me too 
your daughter still harassed by human swords 
if the trojans came to italy against 
your will let them expiate their error 
withhold your help but if they followed many 
oracles from gods and ghosts how could anyone 
overturn your orders now and alter fate 
must i mention ships ablaze at eryx 
the raging storms freed by the king of winds 
or iris on a mission from the clouds 
now juno even meddles with the dead 
the only realm she hadnt touchedsuddenly 
allecto runs amok in the italian towns 
i no longer care for empires i just had hope 
while my luck stood your favorites can win 
if theres no land your heartless wife will give 
the trojans i beg you by troys smoking ruins 
let me take ascanius away from war 
unharmed allow my grandson to survive 
aeneas can be tossed on unknown seas 
following whatever path fate gives 
just let me save the boy from battles terrors 
i control amathus cythera high paphus 
and a shrine in cyprus let him drop his sword 
and lead an unheroic life there tell carthage 
to subdue ausonia tyrian towns 
can rise unhampered what use was surviving 
in a fatal war surrounded by greek flames 
and endless risks on land and sea if they still lack 
their latium their second pergamum 
better if theyd settled on the ashes 
of their fatherland the soil that was troy 
father give back simos and xanthus 
let these wretched people live troys fate again 
now deep rage stung juno why am i being forced 
to shatter my long silence and lay bare old wounds 
which god or man compelled aeneas to choose war 
and make an enemy of king latinus 
fine he came to italy guided by fate 
or forced by mad cassandra did i urge 
him to leave his camp and trust his life to winds 
to put his son in charge rely on walls 
rile up tuscan loyalties and peaceful clans 
which god drove him to deceit what harshness 
of mine wheres juno here or iris from the sky 
if its dreadful that italians circled 
a new troy with flames or that turnus divine 
venilias son pilumnus heir has made a stand 
on his own land what about the trojans torching 
latium seizing foreign fields and plunder 
or choosing inlaws stealing fiances seeking 
peace with words while fixing shields on prows 
it was fine for you to snatch aeneas from the 
greeks to hide him in a hollow puff of cloud 
to turn a whole fleet into just as many nymphs 
but its an outrage if ive aided the rutulians 
aeneas is away and doesnt know so what 
you own paphus cyprus lofty cythera 
why attack fierce hearts and burden towns with war 
am i trying to topple troys unsteady rule 
who threw the wretched phrygians to the greeks 
europe and asia rose in war and broke 
their treatywhy who stole a woman was it 
i who made the trojan cheater storm and 
capture sparta did i arm a lovers war 
your concern was due back then its too late now 
for empty slander and unfair complaints 
so juno pled her case all the skygods murmured 
in favor of one goddess or the other like the 
early rustling of winds caught in forestsa hidden 
murmur warning sailors of the storms to come 
then the almighty father ruler of all things 
began to speak the gods high home fell silent 
the soil trembled underfoot the heavens stilled 
the breezes died the ocean waters settled 
listen and take my words to heart since troy 
and italy were not permitted to make peace 
and your quarrel knows no end today 
i wont distinguish trojans from rutulians 
no matter what their luck or what their hopes 
whether its the fate of italy thats caused 
this siege or trojan error and vicious advice 
the rutulians are not absolved each side 
will bear the consequence of their acts 
royal jove is neutral the fates will find their way 
he swore this by his brothers stygian streams 
the banks bubbling with pitch and the dark abyss 
olympus staggered with his nod all talk was done 
the gods saw him from his gold throne to the door 
meanwhile the rutulians crowded all the gates 
keen to kill their enemies and ring the camp 
with flames aeneas troops were trapped inside the walls 
with no hope of escape wretched they stood 
on the towers uselessly two assarici 
asius imbrasus son and thymoetes 
son to hicetaon took the front positions 
with castor and old thymbris the ramparts sparse defense 
also sarpedons brothers from great lycia 
clarus and thaemon acmon of lyrnesus 
huge as his father clytius or brother menestheus 
hoisted a huge boulder the good part of a hill 
with great effort some tried to save the camp 
with spears some with stones and fire and arrows 
among them was the trojan boy venus 
special care his noble head uncovered 
he shone like a jewel set in yellow gold 
a gem for neck or brow or like bright ivory 
set skillfully in terebinth or boxwood 
his hair spilled down his milky neck over 
the circling choker of soft gold you too 
ismarus your greatsouled people saw you 
aiming shots arrows that youd armed with poison 
noble son of lydia where farmers plow 
rich fields watered with pactoluss gold dust 
mnestheus was there too raised skyhigh by glory 
from the day before when hed beaten turnus 
from the walls and capys whod name capua 
so they fought in the bitter strife of war 
but in the dead of night aeneas left evander 
sailing for the camp of the etruscan king 
he explained his name and race his needs and 
assets and pled with him warning that 
mezentius was gaining allies turnus called for 
violence and his own plans might someday 
fall apart at once tarchon struck a pact 
and gave him men paying lydias debt 
to gods and fate they sailed with a foreigner 
as leader aeneas was in front his ships beak 
carved with phrygian lions in mount idas 
shadow a sweet sight for trojan exiles 
he sat there thinking of the varied phases 
of the war close at his left pallas asked 
about the stars their guides through the inky night 
then about his sufferings on land and sea 
muses open helicon inspire my song 
tell me of the troops aeneas took from tuscan 
shores to man the ships and sail the sea 
massicus led his bronze ship tiger cut the waves 
a thousand of his men on board theyd left 
walled clusium and cosae land of arrows 
lightweight quivers and bows dealing death 
with him was grim abas his men in striking 
armor a gold apollo gleaming on his stern 
his native populonia had given him 
six hundred veterans the island ilva dotted 
with rich iron mines sent three hundred more 
in third place was asilas seer of men and gods 
he read bulls entrails and the stars above 
the speech of birds and lightnings fiery omens he brought 
a thousand men thickset ranks of bristling spears 
pisa tuscan offshoot of alphean pisa 
sent them to follow him then came handsome 
astyr trusting in his horse and varicolored 
armor three hundred more were sent all keen 
to join from round the river minio and caere 
from ancient pyrgi and graviscae land of fevers 
cunarus bravest leader of the lydians 
i wont pass you by nor you cupavo followed 
by a few your helmets swanplumes honored cycnus 
your father changed into a swan by venus and 
her son they say he mourned his lover phathon 
under leafy poplars that were once his sisters 
finding comfort for grief in the muse of song 
as he sang he grew the downy plumes of white 
old age left the earth and soared up to the stars 
his son drove forward the huge centaur leading 
young men like himself its halfhorse figurehead 
loomed high above threatening to throw a rock 
into the waves the long keel plowed deep ocean 
ocnus mustered soldiers from his native banks 
son of the seer manto and the tuscan river 
he gave mantua walls and his mothers name 
mantua rich in different ancestors 
a city with three races and four clans in each 
her strength came from tuscan blood here hatred 
for mezentius propelled five hundred into 
war the river mincius benacus son 
was their warships figurehead veiled in graygreen 
reeds next aulestes led the heavy triton 
a hundred oars rising to thrash the waves 
and roil the marble surface of the sea 
tritons statue scared the blue sea with his conch 
to his waist a hairy man a fish below 
waves churned and roared under the hybrids chest 
so many chosen princes came on thirty ships 
to fight for troy their bronze beaks cut the briny plains 
now day had slipped from sky and kindly phoebe 
trampled high olympus with her nightly horses 
aeneas since his cares gave him no rest 
held the helm himself tending to the sails 
suddenly far out to sea a band of friends 
appeared the nymphs whom kind cybele 
had changed from ships into seagoddesses 
a line of them cut through the waves a number 
equal to the prows that once were moored at shore 
they recognized the king from far and circled him 
in dance cymodocea most skilled in speech 
held the stern with one hand paddling softly under 
water with the other rising from the surface 
she asked confused aeneas are you keeping watch 
aeneas born of gods wake up let out the sails 
were the pines from idas sacred peak once 
your fleetnow ocean nymphs when lying turnus 
rushed at us with flames and swords we broke your ropes 
unwillingly now we search for you at sea 
since cybele pitied us and changed our form 
she made us goddesses that live under the waves 
young ascanius is trapped by walls and trenches 
besieged by spears and latins barbed for war 
arcadian horsemen hold their posts along with strong 
etruscans but turnus plans to send his central column 
to stop their union with the trojan camp 
rise with the dawn and quickly call your men 
to arms take the deathless shield the fire god 
himself ringed with gold and gave to you 
if you trust my words tomorrows sun will see 
huge heaps of dead rutulians as she left 
she pushed the high stern with her hand she knew 
the ways of boats the ship flew across the waves 
quicker than a spear or windswift arrow 
the whole fleet sped up too anchises trojan son 
baffled awestruck took heart at the omen 
gazing at the vault of sky he briefly prayed 
kind cybele mother of the gods to whom 
mount dindyma and towered towns and harnessed 
lions are dear guide me now in battle make this 
omen good and help your trojans goddess 
the full light of the wheeling day was rushing in 
to rout the night already right away 
aeneas told his troops to rally round 
the standards and to brace their hearts for war 
and now as he stood on the high stern he spied 
the trojans and their camp he raised his blazing shield 
the soldiers on the wall raised a warshout 
to the stars fresh hope spurred their rage 
their spears flewlike cranes leaving the river strymon 
under stormclouds honking as they skim the air 
raucous with delight at fleeing the south wind 
the italian chiefs and turnus were surprised 
until they turned to see a fleet nearing the shore 
a massive flood of ships converging on them 
aeneas helmet flashed a flame poured from its crest 
and his shields golden boss shot fire 
like a glowing comets bloodred tail deathly 
in the clear night or scorching sirius 
bringer of disease and drought to feeble mortals 
souring the night sky with unlucky light 
yet bold turnus was no less convinced 
that he could hold the shore and block the ships 
he raised his mens spiritsand added a rebuke 
you have your wishto break the trojans strength 
the god of battles in your hands remember now 
your wives and homes the great deeds of the past 
and our fathers glory lets catch them on the beach 
while theyre afraid while their first steps totter 
on the gangways fortune helps the brave 
he decided whom to take with him to fight 
and whom to trust with the blockaded camp 
meanwhile aeneas soldiers disembarked from 
the high ships many waited for the surf 
to ebb and weaken then leapt into shallow water 
others rowed tarchon scouted out the shore 
avoiding shoals where breaking waves crashed loudly 
seeing where swells gently lapped the land 
he quickly pointed his prow there and asked the crew 
bend to oars my chosen band drive 
your boats ahead let the ships beaks gouge 
this hostile land let your keels furrow it 
no matter if this mooring breaks our fleet apart 
as long as we make land tarchon spoke 
his crews surged to the oars they drove the foamflecked 
ships onto the latin shore until the beaks 
were rammed into dry earth and the keels 
were beached and safetarchon all but yours 
which smashed into the shoals for a while it tilted 
back and forth wedged on a jutting sandbar battered 
by the waves then broke the crew spilled out into 
the seahampered by the splintered oars and floating 
benches and an ebbtow pulling at their feet 
no hesitation held back fierce turnus he threw 
his front line at the trojans all clashed on the shore 
the bugles sang aeneas was the first to wade 
into the throng of farmers a good omen 
cutting latins down killing giant theron 
as he charged his sword sliced therons goldscaled 
tunic and the chain mail made of bronze 
it gashed his flank and drank his blood lichas was next 
sacred to apollo cut from his dead mother 
the child escaped the bladebut to what end 
soon he killed hard cisseus and massive gyas 
as they clubbed the hordes herculess weapon 
didnt help nor strong hands nor their father 
melampus alcides friend while earth served him 
hard tasks as pharus boasted uselessly 
a whirling spear wedged in his blabbing mouth 
you too luckless cydon youd have fallen 
by that trojan hand as you trailed clytius 
your new passion youd be free of your eternal 
love of boys as you lay there pitiful 
but your brothers phorcus sons stopped aeneas 
seven sons with seven hurtling spears 
some glanced off his shield and helmet uselessly 
some kind venus turned aside so they only 
grazed him aeneas called to loyal achates 
bring the spears we pulled from greeks i killed 
at troy not one i throw at the rutulians 
will miss its mark grabbing a huge shaft 
he let it fly it pierced maeons shield of bronze 
ripping open chest and breastplate in one go 
his brother alcanor rushed up to catch him 
stretching out his hands but a spear severed 
his right arm and kept on flying trailing blood 
the dead limb dangled from the shoulder by the sinews 
another brother numitor wrenched the spear 
from maeons corpse but failed to strike aeneas 
with it he merely grazed mighty achates thigh 
now clausus of cures bold in his young strength 
hurled a spear that hit dryops in midsentence 
it entered below the chin and tore his throat 
stripping him of voice and life together he retched 
thick blood and fell his forehead thudding on the earth 
next clausus killed three thracians of boreas noble 
race then three men from ismara sent by their 
father idasdifferent deaths for each halaesus 
and a party of auruncans charged with neptunes 
famous son messapus who excelled with horses 
one side then the other tried to rout 
the enemy right at italys doorstep like winds 
fighting in the sky as they clash with equal 
force and spiritnot one yields nor will the clouds 
and sea the battles balanced in a violent lock 
so the trojan ranks clashed with the latin 
feet treading on feet men crushing men 
elsewhere a stream in flood had strewn the ground 
with tumbled rocks and trees torn from its banks 
the rugged wet terrain forced pallas horsemen 
to dismount and they fled before a latin 
charge unused to being on foot when pallas saw 
he summoned despairs last resort and fired 
their bravery with pleas and bitter words 
youre retreating friends to where by your brave acts 
by king evanders name by wars youve won 
by my hopes to match my fathers fame dont trust 
this path our swords must slash a passage through 
their ranks your noble country calls you 
to the thick of battle and me with you 
the gods are not against us were humans chased by 
humans we all have one soul two hands look 
ocean circles us an endless obstacle 
lands gone will you pick the trojan camp or sea 
he spoke and charged at the packed enemy 
a cruel fate drew lagus to confront him first 
as he tried to hoist a massive boulder pallas 
pierced him with his whirling spear where the ribs 
meet spine pallas worked to free the shaft stuck in 
the bone and hisbo hoped to catch him bending 
and off guard but hisbos fury at his friends 
cruel death distracted him pallas was quicker 
he plunged his sword in hisbos rageful lungs 
next was sthenius then anchemolus rhoeteus 
kin whod dared seduce his fathers wife 
you too twins larides and thymber daucus sons 
each others mirror fell in the rutulian fields 
once a source of sweet confusion to your parents 
but pallas gave you now a cruel distinction 
evanders swordblade hacked off thymbers head 
while laridus lopped hand searched for its arm 
the dying fingers spasming on the hilt 
the sight of pallas dazzling acts and angry shame 
at his rebuke armed the arcadians anew 
now pallas pierced rhoeteus as his chariot 
sped past this gave space and time to ilus 
whod been the distant target of that heavy spear 
rhoeteus had been on the run from teuthras and his 
brother tyres as he died he dangled from his 
chariot his heels hitting rutulian soil 
like fires that a shepherd lights in summer at first 
spaced through the woods then as hoped the winds 
arise and light the gaps so a single jagged 
burning line extends across broad fields he sits 
and gazes at the dancing flames in triumphlike this 
his courageous comrades now united to help 
pallas then halaesus fierce fighter charged them 
huddling in his shields shelter he killed ladon 
pheres and demodocus and lopped off 
strymonius right hand with his gleaming blade 
as it grabbed his throat then he took a rock 
and bashed in thoas face spraying bone and blood 
and brain halaesus father knowing fate once hid him 
in the woods but when death closed the fathers clouded 
eyes the fates seized his son and sacrificed him 
to evanders spear pallas rushed him praying 
father tiber give my spear good luck 
and a path through hard halaesus chest 
your oak will get his armor and his spoils the god 
heard while poor halaesus shielded imaon 
pallas spear found his unprotected chest 
but lausus no small part of battle wouldnt let 
the scope of pallas slaughter terrify the troops 
first he butchered abas that bulwark of war 
then etruscans died and arcadias prime 
and trojan soldiers whod survived the greeks 
the front lines clashed matched in strength and leaders 
the rear guard crowded them and the crush 
hampered their hands and swords on one side 
pallas urged them on on the other lausus 
these two were close in age both handsome both 
robbed of homecoming by fate but the king of 
high olympus didnt let them face each other 
a greater adversary would soon seal their fate 
kind juturna turnus sister urged him to help 
lausus he cut through the lines with his swift chariot 
when he saw his men he shouted stop the fighting 
its for me to confront pallas pallas is mine 
i just wish his father could be here to see 
the men cleared the field as told when they left 
young pallas amazed by the proud command 
stared at turnus from afar and rolled his 
fierce gaze across the mans great frame 
this was his retort to the kings words 
ill win glory either way by taking your rich 
spoils or by a splendid death my fathers 
fine with both enough of threats he walked into 
the open blood froze in arcadian hearts 
turnus leapt down from his chariot ready 
for close combat he came on like a lion 
who spies a distant bull snorting for war 
from his high overlook and flies down for the kill 
when pallas thought his spear could reach turnus 
he ran forward hoping bravery would help 
this mismatched duel praying to the great sky 
i beg you hercules by my fathers welcome 
his feast for a stranger help this great attempt 
let turnus see me ripping off his bloody armor 
as he dies let his dimming eyes fall on 
his victor alcides heard and stifled a great 
groan within his heart shedding futile tears 
jove his father spoke kind words to him the day 
of death awaits all men their time is brief and comes 
just once but they can prolong their fame by action 
this is the task of valor many sons of gods 
were killed by troys high walls my son sarpedon died 
among them turnus too is called by fate 
the finish line of his allotted life is near 
jove spoke and turned his eyes from the rutulian fields 
pallas flung his spear forcefully then pulled 
his gleaming sword out of its sheath the spear 
flew and hit the shields high rim next to 
turnus shoulder forcing a path through 
now even that huge body felt a graze turnus 
aimed his spear with its sharp iron tip at pallas 
brandished it at length and shouted see if 
my spear penetrates a little better 
the quivering shaft ran through the center of the shield 
through so many bronze and iron layers 
so many folds of overlapping bullhide it pierced 
pallas breastplate boring into that great chest 
he tore the warm spear from the woundit didnt help 
as his soul and lifeblood spurted from that hole 
together he collapsed in his own blood his weapons 
clattered and he hit his bloody mouth on the 
hard earth turnus towered over him and said 
arcadians remember this and tell evander 
i return the pallas he deserves ill grant 
whatever honors in a grave whatever solace 
comes from burial but being aeneas host 
will not have proven cheap bracing his left foot 
against the corpse he ripped away the massive weight 
of pallas swordbelt carved to show a wicked crime 
a band of husbands murdered in their bloody beds 
on a single wedding night worked by clonus 
with much gold turnus reveled in the spoils 
hed won how blind the minds of men to fate 
and future to minding limits even in good luck 
thered come a time when turnus would wish 
hed left pallas untouched hed hate this day these spoils 
but a crowd of pallas friends with many groans 
and tears set him on his shield and took him home 
ah pallas youll bring grief and glory to your father 
you entered war and left it the same day but still 
you left behind huge heaps of the rutulian dead 
a heraldno mere rumor of disasterflew 
to tell aeneas his men were at the edge of death 
it was time to help the routed trojans aeneas 
mowed down those around him slashing a wide pathway 
through the fighters on fire hunting you turnus 
so proud of your fresh kill in his mind 
he saw young pallas and evander their feast 
for a stranger and the pledge theyd made 
he took four of sulmos sons alive 
and four that ufens raised to offer to hells shades 
theyd splatter pallas pyre with captive blood 
then from far he hurled his deadly spear at magus 
who had the wit to duck the shaft as it flew over 
he clasped aeneas knees in supplication 
i beg you by your fathers ghost your hopes in ilus 
as he grows spare me for my son and father 
buried deeply in my noble home are bars 
of engraved silver and gold ingots some carved 
some natural the trojan victory doesnt turn 
on this a single soul wont matter much 
aeneas countered with these words the many 
bars of gold and silver that you speak of 
keep them for your sons turnus ended 
barter in war when he murdered pallas so say 
ilus and the ghost of my father anchises 
gripping magus helmet in his hand he bent 
his neck back as he begged and pushed in the sword 
haemons son was nearby priest of diana and 
apollo his head bound with sacred ribbons 
gleaming in white emblems and white robes 
he fled across the field but fell aeneas 
killed him and deaths mighty darkness cloaked him 
serestus carried back the armor as mars trophy 
caeculus of vulcans line and umbro 
from the marsian hills rallied the men 
the trojan raged against them hed already 
lopped off anxurs left arm with his sword 
the shield falling with it anxur had made wild boasts 
and thought his strength would back them perhaps he dreamed 
of fame reaching the stars and white old age 
tarquitus the son of sylvan faunus and the 
nymph dryope showing off his gleaming armor 
blocked aeneas blazing path the trojan pinned 
tarquitus shield to his breastplate with a spear 
and struck his head off as he begged in vain 
searching for more words rolling over 
the warm trunk aeneas said with hatred 
lie there now and scare us no dear mother 
will bury you in earth or pile a tomb on you 
youll be left to vultures or the sea will take 
your sodden corpse hungry fish will suck your wounds 
then he chased down turnus vanguard lucas and 
antaeus and brave numa and blond camers son of 
greatsouled volcens richest landowner among 
ausonians the king of quiet amyclae 
as blood warmed his sword aeneas stormed 
across the plain in triumph like aegaeon 
said to have a hundred arms a hundred hands 
and fifty firebreathing mouths and chests 
when he clashed against joves lightning bolts 
he had fifty shields and swords now he rushed 
niphaeus fourhorse chariot as it approached 
but the horses saw his giant strides and heard 
his awful warcry they shied and bolted spilling out 
niphaeus and dragged the chariot to shore 
lucagus drawn by two white horses charged aeneas 
his brother liger held the reins and steered 
as lucagus fiercely waved his unsheathed blade 
aeneas could not tolerate this hotheaded 
onrush huge holding his spear he ran to face them 
liger shouted these are not the horses 
of diomedes you dont see achilles 
chariot or the phrygian plains your life 
and the war end here so the fool yapped loudly 
he received no answer as lucagus bent 
to goad the horses with his sword bracing 
for the fight by planting forward his left leg 
aeneas hurled his spear it came tearing 
through the bright shields lowest rim and ripped 
through his left thigh he tumbled from the chariot 
writhing on the ground as death came over him 
pious aeneas spoke these bitter words 
lucagus your chariot was not betrayed 
by skittish horses shying at mere shadows 
you leapt from the wheels and abandoned it 
he seized the harness wretched liger held out 
helpless handshed fallen from the chariot too 
i beg you by the parents who raised such a son 
trojan hero let me live pity my prayers 
but aeneas said to these frantic pleas thats not 
how you spoke just now be loyal to your brother 
die he opened up his chest the souls dark home 
such was the slaughter that aeneas dealt across 
the fields raging like a torrent or black 
whirlwind at last his son ascanius and 
the men broke free of camp the siege had failed 
jupiter now came to talk to juno sister 
and most darling wife as well as you thought 
and you were right venus is behind the trojans 
strengthnot just their hands so tireless in war 
not just their fierce souls inured to danger 
juno meekly answered best of husbands why 
torment a feeble wife who fears your rebukes 
if my love had the force it used to once 
and ought to still you who are allpowerful 
would let me carry turnus from the battle 
and keep him unscathed for his father daunus 
but fine let him die and pay the trojans 
with his pious blood and yet hes one of ours 
since pilumnus was his ancestor turnus 
has often heaped your shrine with lavish gifts 
the king of high olympus answered briefly 
if you seek some time for your doomed prince 
by a stay of death and you accept my terms 
then rescue turnus snatch him from fates tightening 
noose this much is allowed but if some greater 
favor lurks under your plea if you want 
the whole war changed you feed on empty hopes 
at this juno wept why cant you give me what 
your words withhold why cant turnus have his life 
unless im wrong an awful death awaits 
a blameless man how i wish false fear toyed 
with me and youd change your plansyou can 
she spoke and swooped down from the sky through 
the breezes wrapped in mist bringing storms 
she reached the trojan army and laurentian camp 
then she formed a weak and wraithlike shadow 
from filmy cloud to be aeneas lookalike 
a marvel she gave it trojan armor aeneas shield 
the plumes over that godly head his gait 
and hollow words sounds without a meaning 
like phantoms said to hover after death 
or visions that deceive our sleeping senses 
the image pranced before the front lines happily 
taunting turnus with rude shouts flaunting weapons 
turnus attacked throwing his hissing spear 
from afar the shadow turned and ran 
turnus thought the real aeneas had turned tail 
in confusion he clung to that empty thought 
where do you run aeneas dont desert the wedding 
my blade will put you in the land for which youve sailed 
the seas he chased him with such shouts waving his drawn 
sword blind to how the winds dispersed his triumph 
the ship of king osinius from clusium 
happened to be moored at a tall and rocky 
outcrop its ladders and gangplank lowered into its depths 
plunged the anxious phantom of aeneas 
on the run but turnus just as quick was at 
its heels not pausing once he leapt over the ramp 
but hed hardly reached the prow when juno broke 
the hawser and the current whisked the boat away 
the flimsy shade no longer tried to hide 
but flew up and merged with the dark clouds 
on land aeneas called turnus out to fight looking 
for the missing man he sent many down to death 
as a stormwind carried turnus out to sea 
confused and ungrateful to be safe 
he gazed back and raised his voice and hands 
up to the stars almighty father did i merit 
such disgrace did you choose this punishment 
where am i going how can i return who will 
i be if they think i ran will i see 
my walls again or those who followed me to war 
have i left them to a ghastly death the horror 
do i see them routed do i hear their dying 
groans what should i do what pit could open 
deep enough for me show me pity winds 
smash this boat against the rocky cliffs 
turnus begs you drive me onto savage reefs 
where no rutulian can follow nor my shame 
and now he wavered first this way then that 
should he fall upon his sword mad with 
his disgrace and drive the raw blade through his ribs 
or throw himself into the waves to strike out 
for the curving shore and trojans spears again 
he tried both paths three times three times great juno 
held him back taking pity on him fair winds 
and favoring tides carried the boat it cut the waves 
and reached his father daunus ancient city 
but now fiery mezentius joined the fight 
at joves command as he charged the joyful trojans 
etruscan ranks surrounded him raining 
hatred and their weapons on a single man 
he was like a headland jutting out to sea 
facing the winds fury exposed to the waves 
bearing all the raging threats of sky and sea 
unmoved he hacked down hebrus dolichaons son 
and with him latagus and palmus as he turned 
to run he smashed latagus face with a rock 
torn from the cliff then sliced through palmus hamstrings 
leaving him writhing weakly he gave lausus 
palmus armor and his crest to wear next fell 
trojan evanthes then paris friend and agemate 
mimas son of amycus and theano 
born the night queen hecuba had paris 
she was pregnant with troys future flames 
paris lies in his paternal city but mimas 
sprawls unknown on the laurentian shore 
like a boar protected many years 
by vesuluss pines or the laurentian swamps 
reed forestonce chased from the heights by snapping dogs 
and trapped in nets it takes a stand snorting rage 
hackles raised and no one dares to make the kill 
men attack with shouts and spears safely distant 
while it slowly circles to attack fearless 
gnashing teeth shaking spears off its back 
just so all the soldiers justly angry 
at mezentius didnt dare close combat 
they harried him from far with spears and shouting 
a greek named acron had arrived from ancient 
corythus an exile his marriage unfulfilled 
far off mezentius saw him in the thick of battle 
wearing purple clothes the gift of his betrothed 
like an unfed lion prowling through high lairs 
driven mad by hunger happy if he sees 
a fleeing goat or young buck breaking in his horns 
then he crouches huge jaws gaping mane on end 
feeding on the entrails letting stinking gore 
rinse out his cruel mouththis was swift 
mezentius pouncing on the crowded ranks 
he hit unlucky acron whose heels beat on 
black earth the bloodied spear snapped by his fall 
but he didnt deign to kill orodes as he 
fled or inflict a spear wound from behind 
he ran to face him man to man a better 
victory without stealth bracing his foot 
on the corpse he pulled hard on his spear and cried 
men here lies orodes a bastion of war 
his friends took up his glad refrain but the 
victim gasped last words vengeance will come 
stranger you wont rejoice long for you as well 
an equal fate awaits soon these fields will hold you 
mezentius smiled thinly through his rage die now 
the father of the gods and king of men will see 
to me he yanked the spear from the body 
bleak rest and iron sleep weighed down orodes eyes 
their light was quenched for an eternal night 
caedicus killed alcathos sacrator 
killed hydaspes rapo killed parthenius 
and strong orses messapus killed clonius 
and erichaetes one thrown from his bareback horse 
one on foot lycian agis came up just to 
fall to valerus brave as his ancestors 
salius killed thronius but nealces 
got him his stealthy longrange arrows were wellknown 
now grim mars dealt death and sorrow equally 
they killed and died alike victors and their 
victims neither side would think to yield 
the gods in joves high halls felt pity for this pointless 
rage the awful suffering of mortals 
here sat venus and there juno looking on as 
pale tisiphone ran riot among thousands 
and now stormy mezentius shaking his great 
spear advanced across the field towering like 
orion when he walks on foot along 
the oceans awesome depths shoulderhigh to waves 
or hauls an ancient ash tree down the mountain 
his feet on the ground his head lost in the clouds 
so mezentius rushed on with fearsome weapons 
aeneas spied him in the enemys front line 
and closed in for the combat unperturbed and steadfast 
mezentius waited for the greatsouled fighter 
measuring how far his spear could fly right hand 
he said youre my only god help me now 
and you the spear i throw lausus i swear youll wear 
the spoils i rip from this pirates corpseyoull be 
the token of my victory he threw his hissing 
spear but it angled off aeneas shield 
and struck noble antores herculess friend 
from argos in the side this man had joined evander 
and settled in a local town poor wretch he died 
from a wound not meant for him as he looked up 
at the sky and thought of lovely argos 
then pious aeneas threw his spear it pierced 
the concave shield of three bronze layers linen 
folds and three bullshides lodging near 
mezentius groinbut its flight stopped there 
the sight of tuscan blood gladdened aeneas 
he grabbed his sword and furiously charged 
his shaken enemy but lausus saw and groaned 
with deep love for his father shedding tears 
lausus i wont silence your memory 
your hard death or your heroism if indeed 
history tells the truth about your exploits 
as his father turned to crawl away helpless 
handicapped dragging his shield and aeneas 
spear his son rushed in between them parrying 
aeneas sword just as his right hand rose to strike 
stopping him and fending off the blow 
his friends shouted loudly throwing spears 
and lances to repel aeneas so the father 
could retreat while shielded by his son 
aeneas furious kept under coveras when 
clouds fling down a fierce hailstorm every farmer 
every plowman scatters from the fields 
the traveler finds shelter under riverbanks 
or the arch of some high cliff while rain 
batters the earth but they resume their day when 
the sun returns so lashed by spears all 
around aeneas waited out the thunderhead 
of war shouting rebukes and threats at lausus 
why this hurry to meet death to dare whats past 
your strength your piety lures you to be rash 
but lausus pressed on the fool fury surged up 
in the trojan and the fates gathered the final 
threads of lausus life aeneas drove his hard blade 
through the young mans body the pointed tip went through 
his shield too thin to match his threats and the tunic 
that his mother wove with soft gold mesh it sank in 
to the hilt blood filled his lungs his mournful life 
descended to the shades abandoning his body 
but when anchises son looked at his dying face 
that ashen otherworldly face he groaned deeply 
pitying the boy and stretched his hand to him 
his own paternal piety came to his mind 
poor boy what can pious aeneas give you 
worthy of your bravery and noble nature 
keep the armor you so loved i return you 
to the ghosts and ashes of your ancestors 
if you can care your unhappy death has one sole 
comfort you fell to great aeneas rebuking lausus 
lagging friends he lifted the corpse up from 
the earth as blood defiled his wellcurled hair 
meanwhile by the tibers banks lausus father 
cleaned his wounds with water propped against a trunk 
his bronze helmet dangled from a branch 
the heavy armor rested on the grass 
his chosen men stood round him as he gasped in pain 
neck bent long beard spilling down his chest 
he kept asking about lausus he kept sending 
men to call him at a sad fathers request 
but lausus weeping friends were bringing the corpse 
on his shield a great man killed by a great wound 
his father heard the groaning from far off 
with terrible foreboding defiling his white hair 
with dust he stretched both hands upward and embraced 
his son did such a lust for life possess me child 
that i let you take my place before the killers 
sword my son did these gashes save your father 
who lives thanks to your death now at last i feel 
the horror of my exile the depth of my wound 
my son i stained your name with my own crimes 
hatred drove me from my fathers throne and rule 
it was i who owed atonement to my peoples 
hate the guilt was mine i should have paid by any 
death at all i still havent left this land 
this light but leave i will he got up on his injured 
thigh resolute and though the deep wound sapped 
his strength he called for his horse this was his pride 
and comfort on it he rode a victor out of every 
combat he spoke to the grieving animal 
rhaebus weve lived long if anything is long 
in mortal terms today youll bring back bloody spoils 
and aeneas head avenging lausus death 
with me or if our force finds no way forward 
well fall together brave beast i dont think 
youd follow orders from a trojan master 
mounting his horse he sat as he always did 
and loaded both hands with sharp lances his helmet 
flashing with its horsehaircrest like this 
he plunged into the fray his heart seething 
with great shame and madness mixed with grief 
and now he called aeneas three times loudly 
aeneas knew him and was glad he prayed 
may great apollo and the father of the gods 
bring this to be start the fight he ran 
to face mezentius his spear poised 
but he replied why try to terrify me now 
you savage who killed my son that was the only 
way to ruin me i dont fear death or care for 
gods hush i come to die but first i bring you 
gifts he hurled his long lance at his enemy 
then another and another as he circled 
him they landed but the gilded shield held them 
three times he wheeled leftward round his watching 
enemy throwing lances three times the trojan 
hauled around the massive iron forest fixed 
in his bronze shield then sick of long delay 
sick of plucking out so many lances pressed by 
the unequal fight at last 
he broke free and hurled his spear at the stallions 
head the horse reared up and thrashed the air with hooves 
throwing his rider beast and man fell in a tangled 
heap the horses shoulder broken from both sides 
shouts set the sky on fire aeneas flew to him 
pulling out his sword and said wheres fierce 
mezentius now and that savagery of spirit 
the tuscan looked up at the sky gulping air 
and answered as he came back to himself 
bitter enemy why these taunts and threats 
killing mes no crime i didnt come to battle 
on such terms my lausus made no pact with you 
for me i ask one thing a kindness for a fallen 
enemy let my corpse be buried i know 
my peoples bitter hate surrounds me block their rage 
i beg you let me lie in lausus tomb he spoke 
and took the sword into his throat knowing death 
his life pumped out in bloody waves over his armor 
book 
meanwhile dawn rose over oceans rim 
aeneas grief would have him turn to burying 
his friends he reeled with pallas death still 
he paid the gods a victors vows at daybreak 
on a mound he raised a huge oak stripped of branches 
and dressed it in bright armorspoils he took 
from lord mezentius to be a gift for you 
great god of war a helmet crest that oozed 
with blood the broken spears and battered breastplate 
punctured in twelve places he set the bronze shield 
to the trunks left side and hung the ivoryhilted 
sword on top then he rallied the triumphant 
soldiers as the leaders thronged around him 
weve managed a great feat my men let go any 
fear that remains here stand a tyrants spoils 
the first fruits of war heres my mezentius 
now we march to king latinus walls 
draw your swords set your hearts and hopes on war 
once the gods tell us to hoist the standards 
and march our men from camp dont be taken 
by surpriseno second thoughts or fear 
for now lets put the bodies of our friends 
in earth the only glory in deep acheron 
honor the great souls who won this country 
with their blood pay their final rites but first 
we must take pallas to evanders mourning city 
the day of darkness swept him off for all 
his courage and plunged him into bitter death 
in tears aeneas went back to the threshold 
where pallas lifeless body lay old acoetes 
was guarding it he was once the armorbearer 
for evander then chosen as a ward for this 
dear child a pairing that would prove less happy 
the slaves stood round the body with the trojan 
troops and trojan women their hair loose in mourning 
and when aeneas came through the high entrance 
the women beat their chests and a great groan rose up 
to the stars the royal tent rang out with grief 
he saw pallas with his head propped up his face 
pale as snow the smooth chest gaping with its wound 
from an italian spear his tears welled again 
when fortune smiled on me poor boy was your 
life the cost so youd never see our kingdom 
or ride in triumph to your fathers house 
this was not my promise to evander when i 
left when he sent me off with an embrace 
to win a mighty empire warning me with fear 
that wed fight fierce men a ruthless race 
still now perhaps beguiled by hollow hope 
he offers vows and heaps gifts on the altar 
while we sadly escort back this lifeless boy 
an empty honorwho owes nothing to the gods 
unlucky man your childs heartrending burial 
awaits is this the glorious return we pledged 
is this my solemn promise but evander you wont 
see him with shameful wounds you wouldnt want to wish death 
on a coward son o italy youve lost 
your great protector and ilus so have you 
aeneas wept and had them lift the wretched body 
he sent a thousand men selected from the troops 
to escort the funeral and share the fathers 
tears scant comfort for so great a grief yet 
an homage due a parents sorrow others quickly 
wove a bier of pliant wicker from arbutus 
and oaken sprigs on top they spread a canopy 
of leaves they laid the young man out high on 
his rustic litter he was like a flower 
plucked by a girls hand a fragile violet 
or drooping hyacinth whose bloom and beauty 
had not started to fade though mother earth 
no longer offered nourishment or strength 
aeneas fetched two garments stiff with gold and purple 
sidonian dido had made these for him with 
her own hands happy in her task working 
the fabric with fine threads of gold he sadly 
laid one over the young man a final honor 
the one he put over the hair the pyre would burn 
he heaped up many warprizes from the laurentians 
to be carried in the long procession and added 
spears and horses taken from the enemy 
then he chose captives to be offerings to the dead 
and bound their arms theyd splash pallas pyre with blood 
now he told his captains to hoist tree trunks 
named for the dead foes armed with their weapons 
wretched acoetes weak with age was led 
along he beat his chest with fists and clawed his face 
falling prostrate on the ground next came chariots 
spattered with rutulian blood and pallas warhorse 
athon without regalia weeping as 
he walked his muzzle wet with giant tears 
they brought his spear and helmet the victor turnus 
had the rest the grieving army followed trojans 
etruscans and arcadians their spears reversed 
when this line of comrades had gone a good way 
aeneas stopped and said with a deep groan 
the harsh fate of war calls me to other griefs 
farewell forever greatest pallas forever 
goodbye he said just this then turned 
his steps back to the high walls of his camp 
meanwhile envoys turned up from the latin city 
wearing olive wreaths and asking for a favor 
could the bodies cut down on the battlefield 
be returned for burial surely there was 
no quarrel with the lifeless victims let him 
show mercy to those he once called hosts and inlaws 
kind aeneas granted them this favor 
not one to be rejected but he added this 
latins what bad luck unjustly tangled you 
in such conflict why turn from your former friends 
you plead for grace for men killed in the lottery 
of war id gladly give it to the living too 
ive only come because my fated home is here 
its not your people whom i fight its your king 
who broke our ties and put his trust in turnus army 
it would have been more fair for turnus to face death 
if he plans to end the war by force and drive 
the trojans out then he and i should have crossed swords 
the winner would have lived through his own skill 
or a gods help now go and stoke the pyre 
under your fallen citizens stunned to silence 
they looked at one another with a searching gaze 
then the oldest drances who detested turnus 
and kept hurling charges at the younger man 
replied trojan hero great in fame greater 
in war how can i raise your praises to the sky 
should i first admire your justice or your prowess 
were glad to take these words back to our native walls 
and if fortune grants a way well ally you 
with king latinus turnus can find his own treaties 
well even raise the great walls owed to you 
by fate and load our backs with trojan rocks 
he spoke they all roared assent as one 
they fixed on twelve days truce now trojans mingled 
with the latins and safely roamed the forest ridges 
in the shortlived peace tall trees rang with axblows 
eagerly they uprooted soaring pines 
cut down fragrant cedar split oak trees with wedges 
and carried mountain rowans on their groaning carts 
now winged rumor heartbreaks herald filled 
evanders ears home and cityrumor whod just 
told of pallas victories in latium 
holding torches their custom for funerals 
arcadians streamed out to the gates the road 
became a line of flame lighting up the fields 
they fell in sadly with the crowd of trojans 
when the mothers saw this group arriving at 
their homes they set the grieving town afire with cries 
nothing could restrain evander he pushed 
into the crowd as pallas bier was lowered 
he collapsed and clung to it groaning sobbing 
at last his pain allowed a passage for his voice 
pallas this wasnt what you pledged your father 
that youd be careful on the killing fields of war 
i knew where pride in ones first arms could lead 
and the sweet honor of victory in first combat 
i mourn your tooyoung sacrifice the harsh lessons 
of a war too close and my vows and prayers 
heard by not one god my blessed wife 
how fortunate you were to die before this grief 
ive outlived my very life im my sons 
survivor i wish id joined the army of our trojan 
allies that rutulian spears had rained on me 
that this march brought my corpse home not pallas 
i dont blame you trojans nor our pact nor 
the hands we clasped as friends this was the fate assigned 
to my old age but if an early death was destined 
for my son im glad he first killed thousands of the 
volscians and led trojans to latium 
pallas i could want no nobler funeral 
for you than one held by pious aeneas the great 
trojans tuscan chiefs and all their troops 
they bring great spoils from the victims of your sword 
you too would be a huge trunk decked with armor 
turnus if pallas were your age or had your strength 
but my sorrow must not keep the trojans 
from the fight go and tell this to your king 
with pallas gone i linger on in hateful life 
only for your sword which owes turnus to me 
and to my son only here is there room for 
luck and glory i find lifes joys repellent 
ill take the news to pallas in the underworld 
now dawn brought her kindly light to heartsick 
humansand with it work and pain father 
aeneas and tarchon set up pyres along the curving 
shore they fetched the corpses of their men 
as was the custom sooty flames were lit below 
the bodies the sky was veiled by grimy smoke 
three times the soldiers in their shining bronze 
ran around the blazing fires three times the horsemen 
circled the sad pyres calling out in grief 
their weapons and the earth were wet with tears 
the shouts of men and blares of horns rose skyward 
some threw spoils from slaughtered latins in the flames 
helmets and fine swords bridles oncewarm wheels 
of chariots others added presents well known 
to the dead their own shields and luckless spears 
many hulking bulls were sacrificed to death 
over flames they slashed the throats of bristly boars 
and sheep seized from the fields holding vigil 
over halfburnt mounds they watched their comrades blaze 
along the shore they could not tear themselves away 
till damp night ferried in the bright starstudded sky 
elsewhere but no differently the anguished latins 
raised up countless pyres of their many dead 
some they buried in the earth some they hauled 
to nearby fields or sent on to the towns the rest 
they set on firea massive heap of muddled corpses 
without order without honor the ruined fields 
and closeset biers blazed for both the armies 
when the third dawn drove chill dark away 
they raked and smoothed deep ash and nameless bones 
mourning and heaped warm mounds of earth on top 
the greatest clamor the greatest part of the long grieving 
was in rich latinus city and its homes 
here sad wives and mothers sons turned into orphans 
and the loving hearts of weeping sisters 
all damned the deadly war and turnus marriage 
he and only he should end this by the sword 
he was the one who wanted to rule italy 
fierce drances fed the flames he swore that turnus 
had been challenged to a duel all alone 
but many dissenting views were heard as well 
in turnus favor he was shielded by the power 
of the queen and his fame from many triumphs 
to crown this commotion as the heated quarrel 
raged glum legates from diomedes great town 
returned with his answer all their efforts 
had done nothing the gifts and gold their urgent 
prayers had been useless they had to look for 
allies elsewhere or ask the trojan king for peace 
this dreadful blow prostrated even king latinus 
the anger of the gods the many freshdug graves 
showed him that aeneas had been sent by gods 
and fate he summoned a high council of the local 
chiefs to meet within his homes tall gates 
they all gathered pouring to the palace through 
the crowded streets as the oldest and most 
powerful latinus grimfaced took the center 
he told the envoys whod arrived from diomedes 
to report their news everything in sequence 
there was a call for silence then obeying 
the kings order venulus began to speak 
citizens we reached diomedes argive 
settlement overcoming all the dangers 
of the road we clasped the hand by which troy fell 
hed built argyripa named for his fathers folk 
after winning ipyx fields near garganus 
when we entered and were granted leave to speak 
we gave our gifts told him our names and country 
named our attackers and the reason for our trip 
to arpi he heard and answered calmly 
happy race of saturns realm italians 
of old what fortune rouses you from peace 
and convinces you to rile up risky wars 
all of us whose swords defiled the fields of troy 
forget what we endured in battle under those high 
walls all the men simos drowned paid dreadful 
penance for our crimes lashed across the earth 
even priam might have pitied us witness 
minervas cruel storm and the cliffs of vengeful 
caphereus homeless menelaus driven 
from that war to other shores reached proteus 
pillars ulysses saw the cyclopes of etna 
think of pyrrhus realm idomeneus ruined 
home locrians left on the coast of libya 
or agamemnon of mycene who led the mighty 
greekshis vile wife struck him down at his own door 
her lover lurked in wait for asias conqueror 
the jealous gods denied me my ancestral altars 
my longedfor wife and lovely calydon 
still the ghastly sight of portents harries me 
my vanished comrades seek the sky on wings 
and flit among the streams as birds this was their 
punishment they fill the cliffs with songs of sorrow 
i should have expected this ever since 
i madly struck a goddess body with my sword 
defiling venus hand with blood no 
dont impose this conflict on me after the fall 
of pergamum ive had no fight with troy i take 
no pleasure in recalling these old sufferings 
the gifts you bring me from your homeland give them 
to aeneas i stood against his fierce sword 
when we fought our duel trust me i saw how high 
he loomed above his shield how forcefully 
he hurled his spear if idas land had raised two more 
like him the trojans would have reached the argive towns 
with ease and defeated greece would mourn her fate 
while we waited round the sturdy walls of troy 
our victory was stalled by hector and aeneas 
rebuffed for ten years both men excelled 
in bravery and skill in battle aeneas 
in piety if you can clasp hands and make 
a pact dont let your weapons clash in war 
best of kings youve heard the kings response 
and the views he holds on this great conflict 
hed hardly finished when an anxious hubbub 
of mixed voices rose up from the latinslike 
a rushing river slowed by boulders its trapped waters 
churn and roar currents crash against the banks 
once they were calm and the anxious cries died down 
the king invoked the gods and spoke from his high throne 
latins i wish wed made the better choice 
to solve this crisis earlier and not to call 
a council now with enemies camped by our walls 
we were rash to battle with a race of divine 
blood theyre unconquered no fights tire them 
even in defeat they cant lay down the sword 
if you hoped for aetolian allies cease to 
anyone can hope but you see the odds 
as for the rest of our affairs everything 
lies smashed in ruins before your eyes and hands 
i blame no one what the greatest bravery 
could do we did we fought with all our kingdoms strength 
ill tell you the decision ive now reached 
after much reflection listen to my words 
i own an ancient tract along the tuscan river 
it stretches west of the sicanians 
the arauncans and rutulians plow the flinty 
hills and use the wildest parts for pasture 
all this land with its pineclad mountain 
ridge should be added to a trojan pact 
lets fix fair terms and summon them to share our rule 
if this is their desire they can settle here 
and build their walls if they want other lands 
and people and can safely leave our soil 
lets build them twenty ships of native oak if they 
have the men for more theres timber nearby 
they can say how many ships they need 
and of what sort well give them workers bronze 
and docks also a hundred latin nobles must go 
to report my words and ratify the treaty 
extend olive branches offer gifts 
and weights of gold and ivory my throne 
and robe of state emblems of my rule 
lets consult on how to help our ruined land 
drances hostile still stood up turnus glory 
was a bitter goad to him a source of secret 
envy he was free with wealth and eloquent 
but froze in war a wise guide in councils 
but good at rousing riots noble on his 
mothers side but unknown on his fathers 
with his words he stoked the common anger 
good king you ask advice on issues that are 
clear without debate they all know how 
our luck goes but they wont say it aloud 
turnus should stop his swaggering and let me speak 
his ill favor with the gods his evil character 
ill say it let him threaten me with death 
have caused many of our greatest men to die 
have sunk our town in grief meanwhile he provokes 
the trojan camp and waves his weapons at the sky 
trusting in escape best of kings add just 
one thing to the many gifts and words you send 
the trojans dont let anyone use violence 
to stop a father from the marriage of his daughter 
to a great man in a fitting union 
thus bringing peace but if such fear grips your minds 
and hearts lets beg this favor from the man himself 
turnus grant our king and country their just rights 
why keep throwing our poor people in harms way 
youre the source of all our suffering 
war wont save us we all ask for peace 
and the single sacred bond that brings it 
ill be the first to beg though you claim i hate you 
so be it have pity on your people set 
your pride aside youve lost so leave in our rout 
weve seen enough of death and ruined land 
if glory drives you and theres so much strength in you 
if a palace as your dowry is so precious 
dare your confidence against the enemy 
so turnus can win a royal wife should 
our cheap lives be scattered through the battlefields 
a crowd unburied and unwept you 
if theres any spine in you any of 
your fathers fight go face your challenger 
turnus temper blazed up at this speech 
he groaned and burst out with deep feeling drances 
theres always floods of eloquence from you 
when battle calls for action youre the first to come 
whenever councils called but the senate doesnt 
need the boasts that fly from you while you are safe 
while the enemys outside the walls and our 
moats dont run with blood so thunder eloquently 
as you do but dont charge me with fear until 
your hand has heaped up piles of trojan dead 
and decked the fields with trophies shall we see 
what real courage can do we dont have far to go 
to find the enemy they ring our walls 
come were off to battlewhy so slow 
will your fighting always be your flapping tongue 
those feet so quick to flee you say ive lost 
whod rightly say id lost you filth you saw 
the swollen tiber surge with trojan blood 
evanders house and family mowed down 
the arcadians stripped of armor losing 
is not how bitias and huge pandarus 
saw it nor the thousand men i sent to hades 
in one day while trapped inside the trojan walls 
war wont save us fool prophesy this wisdom 
to aeneas and yourself go on alarm 
us all with panic praise the power of a twicedefeated race deride latinus forces 
youd claim the leaders of the myrmidons tremble 
at trojan weaponsachilles and tydeus son 
as well indeed and the aufidus flows backward 
from the adriatic the man says my threats 
scare him clever ploy and backs his lies by quaking 
have no fear youll never lose your life 
at my hands keep it in your coward chest 
king i return to our important plans 
if you dont trust to weapons any more 
if were on our own and completely ruined 
after one repulse if fortune cannot change 
lets beg for peace holding out our wobbly hands 
but oh if we had some of our usual courage 
id count the man who chose to die and bite the dust 
instead of seeing such a day lucky beyond 
others in the fight a paragon of courage 
but if we have supplies and unharmed men 
if italian troops and towns are still our allies 
if the trojans glory cost them dear in blood 
they too had their funerals the same storm battered 
all of us why this shameful hesitation 
at the start why do we tremble at the bugle 
the passing days the changes brought by shifting time 
can improve much sly fortune comes in different shapes 
she can set her victims back on solid ground 
if arpi wont help messapus and good 
tolumnius will and the chiefs so many sent 
no small glory will attend the chosen men 
of latium and the laurentian fields 
and camilla of the noble volscian race 
with her mounted troops like blooms in bronze 
if the trojans challenge me to single combat 
with your blessing if i impede our common good 
ill take my chances with so much at stake 
victory hardly hates or shuns my hands 
ill fight him bravelyno matter if hes stronger than 
achilles or wears vulcans armor like him i pledge 
my life to you and to father latinus i 
turnus a lesser warrior than none before 
aeneas calls on me alone i hope he does 
if the gods are angry it should not be drances 
who pays the price of death or wins glory and honor 
while they clashed over these doubtful matters 
aeneas moved his camp and army and now 
a messenger ran through the palace sowing 
chaos filling all the town with terror his news 
the trojans and their tuscan troops were marching 
from the tiber their army swept the plains 
at once the common folk were shaken and disturbed 
their rage grew at this stinging provocation 
eagerly the young men roared for weapons 
sad fathers wept and murmured everywhere 
a clamor of dissent rose to the skies noisy 
as a flock that comes to roost in a high forest 
or raucous swans who honk along the fishrich 
padusa and its chattering marshes turnus 
grabbed his chance thats right citizens call 
a council sit here praising peace meanwhile 
theyre armed and invading he said no more 
but leapt up and sprinted from the palace 
commanding volusus to arm the volsican squadrons 
and lead the rutulians messapus and coras 
arm the cavalry with coras brother and spread 
them out some should back the gates others man 
the towers the rest attack where and when i say 
at once all the city scurried to the walls 
but latinus left the council dropping 
his grand plans dismayed at this dark turn 
blaming himself often for not welcoming 
aeneas to the city as his soninlaw 
meanwhile men dug trenches at the gates or hauled up 
stones and stakes the harsh bugle blared wars bloody 
signal then a mingled crowd of wives and children 
ringed the wall this last struggle called them all 
the queen rode in her chariot to pallas temple 
and high citadel many mothers with her 
bringing gifts lavinia sat beside her 
the cause of so much grief her lovely eyes cast down 
the women entered and lit incense scenting all 
the shrine pouring out sad pleas virgin 
pallas great in war queen of battle 
break the spears of the phrygian bandit hurl him 
prostrate on the ground before our city gates 
turnus armed himself impatiently raging 
to fight he put the bright breastplate on 
bristling with bronze mail his calves were cased in gold 
his sword strapped to his side his head still bare 
he gleamed with metal as he swept down from the 
heights exultant in his mind hed already won 
he was like a horse who rips his tether and 
escapes the stalls reaching open grassland 
free at last he heads for pastures and for herds 
of mares or flashes out for streams he used to bathe in 
whinnying holding high his head 
joyous as his mane plays on his back and neck 
camilla and her volscian army rushed to meet him 
at the gates the queen leapt down from her horse 
all the cohort followed suit dismounting 
in a fluid move she said turnus 
if the brave are right to trust themselves 
ill dare to charge aeneas troops and ride alone 
against the tuscan cavalry this is my pledge 
let me scout out wars first dangers while you 
take a post along the walls and guard the city 
turnus answered eyes fixed on the dangerous girl 
o glory of italy how can i thank you 
or repay you for nowsince your courage 
dwarfs rewardshare the struggle with me 
vile aeneas rumor says and our scouts 
confirm has sent his lightarmed horse ahead 
their hooves shake the plains as he heads for town 
over mountain peaks and lonely ridges ill set 
an ambush at a byroad in the forest and 
guard the pass at both ends with armed men 
youll confront the charging tuscan cavalry 
with fierce messenus latin squadrons and 
tiburtus troops lead them and take charge 
he urged messapus and the allied chiefs to combat 
too then he left to meet the enemy 
theres a winding valley thats well suited 
to treachery and tricks of war on both sides 
dark slopes press it with dense growth a faint pathway 
leads there from a narrow stinting pass 
above among the crags and near the peak 
theres a hidden clearing and safe shelter 
you can attack from either side or roll down 
giant rocks while standing on the ridge 
turnus knew the way he came to take 
his post lurking in the dangerous woods 
now in her high home latonas daughter 
summoned opis swift of foot from her band 
of sacred virgins she said sadly dear girl 
camilla leaves for cruel combat with my armor 
which wont help shes loved by me beyond all 
othersnot through some new passion this is 
no sudden sweetness that has moved my heart 
when metabus hated for his haughty rule 
left his land and ancient privernum fleeing 
from the heart of war he took his baby 
with him he called her camilla altering 
her mothers name casmilla by one letter 
clutching her to his chest he rode for long and 
lonely forest crests but when sharp spears menaced 
on all sides and volscian soldiers circled him 
as he fled he spied the river amasenus 
full and frothing at its bankssuch a storm 
had broken from the clouds he could swim across 
but fear for his cherished burden held him back 
he thought it through and made a quick and painful choice 
he took the giant spear hard with knots 
and seasoned oak that his strong hand carried 
into war wrapped his child in woodland corkbark 
and tied this handy bundle to the spears center 
he raised it in his massive fist and cried to heaven 
kind diana of the woods a father vows his 
child to you shes your supplicant and holds 
your weapon first as she flies from enemies 
i beg you goddess take whats yours i yield her now 
to the chance winds he drew back and threw 
the spinning spear poor camilla flew across 
the roaring river on the hissing shaft 
metabus the great crowd on his heels ever 
closer plunged into the riverand emerged 
the grassy bank gave back both spear and child 
dianas gift since towns wouldnt let him in their 
homes or walls he was too fierce to be civil 
he fed his child among the brush and bristling lairs 
a humble shepherd in the lonely mountains 
he nursed her on a wild mares fresh milk 
hed squeeze the udders drops onto her baby lips 
and when she first walked on her infant feet 
he armed her hands with a sharp lance and hung 
a bow and arrows from her tiny shoulder 
instead of gold clasps and long capes to wear 
a tigers pelt draped from her head over her back 
already then she scattered childsized spears from tender 
hands and whirled a smooth sling round her head 
bringing down a crane or snowy swan 
many mothers in the tuscan towns were keen 
to wed her to their sons in vain she was happy 
with diana and nursed an endless love of weapons 
and virginity untouched i wish this war 
had not encouraged her to challenge trojans 
shes precious to me shed remain one of our band 
but since harsh fate is at her heels glide down 
from the sky and visit latium nymph 
where grim battle rages under gloomy omens 
take this quiver draw an arrow to avenge her 
whoever wounds her sacred flesh trojan 
or italian must pay an equal price 
in blood ill carry her poor body and unlooted 
armor in a hollow cloud for burial 
in her own land jangling veiled in a dark whirlwind 
opis slipped down through the gentle breezes 
meanwhile the trojan army tuscan chiefs 
and all the cavalry marshaled in ranks 
approached the walls the horses reared and whinnied 
through the fields fighting their tight reins wheeling 
this way and that everywhere the land bristled 
with spears fields aflame with sunlit weapons 
messapus and the fastmoving latins faced them 
on the plain also coras with his brother 
and camillas wing spears jutted skyward 
in hands pulled back to throw and lances quivered 
the march of men and screams of horses grew hot 
each side stopped short within a spears throw 
then suddenly burst forward screaming spurring 
frothing horses weapons rained down on all sides 
as thick as snow shadowing the sky to darkness 
tyrrhenus and fiery aconteus smashed 
headon wielding lances they were the first to fall 
colliding loudly as their horses crashed together 
breastbone against breastbone aconteus 
flew off like a thunderbolt or stone hurled from 
a catapult his lifebreath scattered to the breezes 
now the lines broke up the latins wheeled 
their horses to the walls and slung their shields across 
their backs acilas chased them with the trojan troops 
but near the gates the latins raised the shout again 
and pulled around their horses supple necks 
now it was the trojans who retreated with slack 
reins they were like the oceans ebb and flow 
sometimes it sweeps to shore and coats the rocks 
with froth its arc soaking the far sand 
sometimes it quickly ebbs sucking back 
the rolling scree as the shallows boil 
twice tuscans pushed rutulians to the walls 
twice they were repelled and had to guard their backs 
with shields but in the third clash all the ranks were 
tangled each man marked his target then truly 
you could hear the dying moans in that bloody 
mess of bodies weapons halfdead horses 
twitching in mens blood the savage fighting surged 
orsilochus fearing to face remulus 
flung his spear at his horse it went in 
by the ear and the stallion reared pawing 
at the air in agony his rider thrown 
writhed on the ground catillus killed illas 
and herminius a huge man with huge courage 
and huge weapons his blond head and torso bare 
not afraid of wounds his giant frame exposed 
a spear pierced his broad shoulders and stuck there 
quivering it folded him in pain pools 
of gore were everywhere fighting they dealt 
death with iron seeking wounds to die with glory 
there in the carnage raged camilla with her quiver 
one breast bared for battle like an amazon 
she hurled a rain of pliant lances or raised 
her heavy battleax in her tireless hand 
dianas gold bow jangled on her shoulder 
even when she had to yield she shot arrows 
while escaping her bow turned to face the fight 
around her was her chosen band young larina 
tulla and tarpeia swinging her bronze ax 
all daughters of italy divine camilla 
chose them as her honorguard to help in peace 
or warlike amazons riding across the river 
thermodon or fighting by hippolyte 
in painted armor or shrilling loudly when mars child 
penthesilea came back in her chariot 
and her crescentshielded women troops rejoiced 
fierce girl who were the first and last to fall 
under your spear how many dying bodies did you 
spread on earth first eunaeus son of clytius 
her pine lance pierced his unguarded chest 
and he fell retching streams of blood dying 
he bit the bloody earth coiling round his wound 
next liris and pagasus one thrown from 
his fallen horse and reaching for the reins 
one rushing to help no weapon in his hand 
she dropped both there and added amastrus 
hippotas son rising in her seat she speared 
tereus demophon harpalycus 
and chromis every shaft whirled from her hand 
found its trojan far off the hunter ornytus 
was riding an ipygian horse in foreign armor 
a hide stripped from a bull sat on the fighters 
massive shoulders and a whitefanged wolfjaw 
gaped over his head in those rustic hands 
he held a hunting knife he rode in the middle 
of the ranks but stood a full head higher 
overtaking him it was easy in the rout 
she pierced him through and said with hate tuscan 
did you think that you were flushing forest beasts 
the day has come that shows your boasts were lies 
and at a womans hands but youll take great glory 
to your fathers shades camillas spear killed you 
next were butes and orsilochus largest 
of the trojans she speared butes from behind 
between the helmet and the breastplate where his neck 
gleamed white on the left the shieldside 
orsilochus chased her in a giant circle 
but she tricked him into tighter ones hunting 
the hunted then reared up and smashed her heavy ax 
into his bones and armor as he begged for mercy 
frantically warm brains from the blows streamed down 
his face aunus fighting son an apennine 
chanced on her and froze in fear at the sight 
he was a good ligurian liar while fate allowed 
when he saw he couldnt use his horse 
to get away and dodge the queens attack 
he tried a shrewd pretense and said with cunning 
whats so great about a woman counting on 
her brawny horse forget escape be brave enough 
to meet me face to face on even ground fight me 
on foot youll soon know whose boasts of bravery 
are meaningless enraged and hot with fury 
she handed her horse to a friend facing him 
on foot and unafraid their weapons were the same 
a bare sword and a light shield the soldier 
thought his trick had worked off he raced at once 
pulling round the bridle to escape 
using iron spurs to goad his horse stupid 
ligurian she cried puffed up with pride in vain 
you tried your slippery native skills for nothing 
your ploy wont bring you back unharmed to lying 
aunus on swift feet just like a darting flame 
she overtook his horse grabbed its reins 
and spilled his hated blood in vengeance 
easily the way a sacred falcon soars from 
some tall crag to chase a dove high in the clouds 
and catches her tearing out her guts with curling 
claws from the sky fall blood and tattered feathers 
the father of the gods and men throned on high 
olympus did not fail to see this he spurred 
tuscan tarchon into rage and bitter battle 
with no gentle goad tarchon galloped out 
to the slaughter and retreating ranks 
urging on the cavalry with varied shouts 
naming them reviving beaten troops for war 
whats your fear tuscansalways slow to fight 
but never shamed by it whats this great cowardice 
a woman scatters you and routs your ranks 
we carry swords and spearsfor what youre not 
slack for loves nocturnal combat or when 
the curved flute calls for bacchic dances yes 
wait for feasts and wine and groaning tables 
heres passion and dedication till the seer 
says alls safe till meaty sacrifices call you 
to the groves with that he whipped his horse 
into the fray prepared for death charging wildly 
at venulus he tore him violently off his 
horse and rode off with his enemy clutched to 
his chest shouts rose to the sky all the latins 
turned to watch tarchon flew like fire over 
the plain with his armed prey he snapped venulus spear 
at its metal tip groping for an open spot 
to stab a deathblow venulus fought back 
keeping that hand from his throat surviving force 
by force like a tawny eagle whos snatched up 
a snake and soared away twining talons in 
the wounded reptile the snake forms slick coils 
raising its rough scales and hissing trying 
to rear up but as the eagle beats the air 
with wings its hooked beak mauls its thrashing victim 
just so tarchon took his prize from tiburs ranks 
triumphant the tuscans followed on their chiefs 
example and successthey charged then arruns 
doomed by fate circled swift camilla with his 
spear a crafty fellow searching for an easy 
chance while the girl rode raging in the ranks 
arruns stole up close and followed silently 
when she returned from killing enemies 
he yanked his quick reins furtively and trailed her 
ruthless he tried this approach and that traced 
her path on every side and shook his wellaimed spear 
by chance chloreus once cybeles priest 
was gleaming from afar in phrygian armor 
he rode a foaming mount whose leather saddlecloth 
was plumed with bronze scales and golden links 
standing out in his exotic reds and purples 
he shot cretan arrows from a golden lycian 
bow it hung from the seers shoulders 
his helmet was gold too a golden knot tied up 
the rustling linen folds of saffron cloak 
his tunic and his asian leggings were embroidered 
the huntress stalked this one man blindly in the strife 
of war she hoped to hang his trojan weapons 
in a temple or flaunt herself in captive gold 
a girl on fire with a females lust for spoils 
riding recklessly through all the ranks 
at last arruns saw his chance from where he lurked 
he threw his spear praying to the gods above 
greatest of the gods you who guard sacred 
soracte we worship you first apollo when pinetrees 
feed your flames we your followers 
trust our faith and plant our steps on your live coals 
almighty father let my sword obliterate 
this source of shame i dont want spoils or trophies 
nothing that is hers my other feats will bring 
me fame just let me kill this pestilence 
and ill return unhonored to my native town 
apollo heard and granted one part of the plea 
the rest he scattered to swift breezes yes 
arruns could kill the girl in her distraction 
with a sudden blow but hed never see his 
noble land again the south wind took those words 
he threw his spear it whistled through the breeze 
all the volscians turned their sharp eyes mindful 
to their queen but she failed to note the rush 
of air the weapon flying through the sky 
until the spear found its mark wedged below 
her naked breast it drank deeply of her blood 
her stricken band rushed up to catch their falling queen 
arruns the most terrified of all fled 
in mingled fear and joy he didnt dare to trust 
his spear further or face camillas weapons 
he was like a wolf whos killed a shepherd 
or a giant bull and runs to hide in trackless 
heights before the vengeful spears can find him 
he knows he went too far and tucks his trembling tail 
below his belly heading for the woods 
anxiously he hid himself from sight 
content to get away and mingle with the ranks 
camilla dying tugged the spear but its iron 
tip was wedged too deeply in her ribs 
her blood draining she collapsed her eyes fell 
chill with death her bright complexion faded 
as she died she called to her friend acca 
shed been loyal beyond others to camilla 
the only one to share her cares ive fought 
this far sister acca now a bitter wound 
has finished me the world grows dark with shadow 
run and take these last commands to turnus 
he must take up the fight and keep the trojans 
from the town and now goodbye she released 
her horses reins and weakly slipped to earth cold 
departing from her body bit by bit her head 
and neck drooped down in death her weapons fell her soul 
fled with a groan of protest to the shades below 
now a huge cry rose and struck the golden stars 
with camilla down the fight was crueler still 
the trojan army tuscan chiefs and evanders 
cavalry rushed at each other in dense ranks 
dianas sentry opis had been resting on 
a high ridge for some time calmly gazing at 
the fight as the raging men sent up a roar 
she saw from far away camillas killing 
she groaned and said these heartfelt words oh no 
my child youve paid too cruelly for your attempt 
to wound the men of troy in war your service 
to diana your solitude in the wild woods 
shouldering her quiver was no help to you 
yet the queen wont let you be dishonored 
in your final hour your death wont want for fame 
among the nations nor will you suffer shame 
dying unavenged he whose wound defiled you 
will die as he deserves below that peak there lay 
a giant burialmound its soil shaded by oaks 
for the ancient king dercennus laurens 
swooping down the lovely goddess landed 
here first and looked for arruns down below 
there he was gleaming in his armor puffed up 
with vain pride leaving us she asked turn 
this way come and die receive a fitting prize 
for camillas death dianas shafts will kill 
even the likes of you the goddess took a speedy 
arrow from her golden quiver and drew her bow 
hating him pulling evenly until 
the curved tips almost met her left hand touched 
the iron tip her right the bowstring by her breast 
arruns heard the hissing arrow and the rush 
of air just as the iron point lodged in his flesh 
his friends forgetful left him there gasping out 
his life groaning in the fields ignoble dust 
but opis soared on wings to high olympus 
their leader gone camillas lightarmed wing fled first 
in shambles the rutulians and fierce atinas 
ran as well the scattered chiefs and headless legions 
looked to safety horses wheeled in retreat 
none could hold against the trojan onslaught 
bringing death none could take a stand 
their unstrung bows on crouching backs they shook 
the pockmarked plain with horses at full gallop 
a murky cloud of black dust rolled toward the city 
mothers beat their breasts along the lookouts 
and raised their womens shrieks to the high stars 
the first to burst in at a gallop through the gates 
brought the enemy mixed in with them and met 
a wretched death right at the walls they died impaled 
on swords on their own soil next to the very safety 
of their homes a group closed the gates 
scared to admit allies or yield to their pleas 
then came a wretched slaughter of the latins those 
guarding the gates and those impaled on the guards swords 
before the faces of their weeping parents 
some were thrown into the trenches by the 
desperate stampede some let go their reins 
and wildly rammed the gates and bolted doors 
on the walls trembling mothers strained to rain down 
weapons on the trojans mimicking camilla 
spurred by love of country they used oaken posts 
and firecharred stakes in place of iron they burned 
to be the first to perish for their citys sake 
the ghastly news hit turnus in his forest 
acca told the young man of the massive rout 
the volscian ranks wiped out camilla dead 
the enemys assault how trojans swept the field 
with mars support the panic at the walls in rage 
as jupiters cruel will demanded turnus 
quit his hilltop ambush and left the rugged forest 
he was hardly out of sight heading for 
the plains when aeneas crossed the mountain ridge 
to open fields and put dark woods behind him 
now both were riding fiercely for the town 
with all their troops not much space between them 
at the moment that aeneas saw the plain 
smoking with dust and the laurentian army 
turnus saw savage aeneas in armor and heard 
the infantrys approach and panting horses 
both would have tried their luck in war at once 
but rosy sun had washed his tired team in spanish 
waters bringing night as day glided away 
they camped before the town and built their ramparts 
book 
as soon as turnus saw the tide had changed 
and the defeated latins looked to him to pay 
his pledge he blazed with new and ruthless courage 
like a lion on the plains of africa 
who strikes at last after the poachers spear 
has pierced his chestfearless full of joy 
he tosses his thick mane breaks the shaft wedged 
in the wound and roars from bloodstained jaws 
just so turnus burning fury reached its peak 
wildly he addressed the king theres no delay 
in turnus no reason for aeneas coward band 
to eat their words or break their pledge ill fight 
bring the offerings father set the terms 
either ill dispatch this trojan traitor down to 
tartarus let the latins sit and watch refuting 
by my sword the charge against us all or else 
well be his slaves and lavinia his wife 
latinus answered calmly peerless fighter 
your fierce courage outstrips other mens 
so much the more i must reflect with care 
on all the outcomes that i fear you rule 
your father daunus land plus many towns taken 
by force you have my gold my goodwill too 
laurentian lands and latium have other 
girls of noble birth let me speak these harsh words 
honestly take them to heart i had no right 
to give lavinia to any former suitor 
all the gods and men prophesied this 
conquered by my love for you our common blood 
my wifes sad tears i broke all bonds stole his 
right bride from my sontobe and waged an unjust 
war you can see the battles and bad luck 
that dog me since youve borne the brunt of them 
beaten in two fights we can barely nurse 
italys hopes at home our spilled blood warms 
the tibers waters our broad fields gleam white with bones 
why go back and forth to change my mind is madness 
if im prepared to accept allies once youre dead 
why not end this conflict while you live how would 
your rutulian kin and all of italy 
respond if i gave you up to death may god 
forbid as you fought to win my child 
think of wars uncertainty pity your old 
father forlorn and far away in ardea 
these words had no effect on turnus fury 
it flared up still more savage for being soothed 
as soon as he could speak these words burst out 
that care you have for mekindly discard it 
best of kings and let me trade my life for glory 
father i too fling spears with force the wounds 
that i inflict draw blood as well his mother 
wont be lurking near in swirls of empty mist 
to cover his retreat in an unmanly cloud 
but the queen aghast at this new combats risk 
ready to die wept and clasped her fierce 
soninlaw turnus by these tears by my 
honor if it touches you at allyoure my 
only hope my sole relief in grim old age 
latinus glory and his power our whole reeling 
house all rests on you i ask just this dont fight 
the trojan your fate in that duels mine as well 
ill leave this hated light of day with you 
ill never be enslaved and see aeneas as 
my soninlaw lavinia heard her mothers words 
tears ran down her burning cheeks a deep blush 
warmed her skin and spread its fire through her face 
just like indian ivory stained by crimson blood 
or snowy lilies tinted red by a rose 
bouquet such colors stood out on the young girls face 
his love churned in turnus he stared at her hotter 
still to fight and spoke curtly to amata 
i beg you not to send me off with tears and evil 
omens mother when i leave for battles brutal 
combat turnus cannot choose his hour of death 
idmon take my message to the trojan king 
it wont please him when dawns rosy chariot 
reddens the sky he should not lead out his men 
let trojan and rutulian weapons rest 
well stop this string of battles with our blood 
on that field lavinia will be won as wife 
he spoke and hurried to his home calling for 
his horses happy as they neighed before him 
orithyia gave them to pilumnus as an honor 
a team whiter than snow swifter than the wind 
the chariotdrivers stood around thumping the horses 
chests combing their flowing manes turnus seized 
a breastplate stiff with gold and orichalcus 
he strapped on his sword and shield and placed 
the crimsoncrested helmet on his head 
the god of fire had forged the sword for turnus father 
daunus and tempered the bright blade in stygian waters 
then he raised the sturdy spear that leaned against 
a giant central column spoils from actor 
the auruncan and shook its undulating length 
nows the time my spear now ive never called 
in vain great actor carried you now turnus 
right hand carries you let me strike dead 
that phrygian halfman let me strip and smash 
his armor ill foul with dirt those waves of hair 
dripping with scented oil and crimped with a hot iron 
such a rage drove turnus as he raved sparks flew 
from his face his eyes flashed fire he was like 
a bull that bellows terribly as combat starts 
trying out its anger on a tree trunk 
with its tusks goring all the winds with wounds 
pawing sand as prelude for the battle 
just as fierce in his mothers armor aeneas 
roused himself to fight and stoked his rage 
he was glad this mutual pact would end the war 
then he soothed his friends and fearful ilus 
with talk of fate and ordered that a firm response 
be sent to king latinus with the terms for peace 
as fresh dawn flecked the mountain peaks with light 
and the horses of the sun soared over oceans 
edge streaming light out of their flaring nostrils 
rutulians and trojans checked the dueling ground 
next to the walls of the great city they put out 
firepans and grassy altars for their common 
gods priests in aprons wearing sacred vervain 
on their brows fetched the fire and water 
the ausonians marched up with their lances spilling 
out the crowded gates from the other side 
the tuscantrojan army rushed up with diverse armor 
and so much iron youd think mars own cruel strife 
had mustered them in the center captains 
milled around proud in gold and purple 
mnestheus from the blood of assaracus brave 
asilas and neptunes son messapus 
the horsetamer at the sign each side pulled back 
staking spears in the soil propping up 
their shields women unarmed crowds and weak old men 
came in an eager flood to fill the roofs 
and towers others stood by the high gates 
juno gazed down from a hilltop now called alban 
in those days it had no name no glory and no 
honor looking at the plain and armies 
trojan and laurentian and latinus city 
at once as one goddess to another she spoke 
to turnus sister queen of lakes and roaring rivers 
jupiter the high skyking had honored her 
this wayafter stealing her virginity 
nymph beauty of the rivers dearest to me 
you know ive loved you more than any other latin 
girl whos suffered greatsouled joves unwelcome lust 
i freely let you have a share of sky 
learn the griefnot caused by methat waits for you 
while the fates and fortune seemed to favor 
latium i shielded turnus and your city 
now i see him heading to an unfair death 
the day of death and devastation comes 
i cannot watch this combat they agreed on 
if you dare to help your brother do it you should 
maybe better times will come for us who suffer 
shed barely finished but juturnas tears were falling 
she beat her lovely breast three or four times 
this is not the time for tears saturns daughter 
told her hurry if theres any way rescue him 
from death stir up war and wreck the treaty 
they drew up ill take responsibility 
she left her wavering a harsh wound in her heart 
the kings rode out latinus in his massive fourhorse 
chariot twelve golden rays around his gleaming 
browthe emblem of his ancestor the sun 
a snowwhite pair pulled turnus in his hand 
he brandished two broadheaded iron spears 
from the facing camp marched out father aeneas 
founder of the roman race his starbright shield 
and godsent armor blazing and ascanius 
romes other great hope a priest in pure robes 
fetched a bristly boars young and an unshorn sheep 
and stood the beasts next to the flaming altars 
the men now faced the rising sun sprinkled salt meal 
from their hands and cut tufts off the victims brows 
then they poured libations on the altars 
pious aeneas drew his sword and prayed 
i call on you as witness sun and this land 
for which ive borne such suffering and you 
almighty father and you juno his wife 
a kinder goddess now i hope and you famed 
father mars whose will inflicts all wars on us 
i call on springs and flowing rivers all the powers 
in high heaven and the bluegreen sea if chance 
grants triumph to italian turnus the losers 
will retire to evanders town ilus 
will leave this land and aeneas men will never 
rise in war as rebels or bare their blades against 
this realm if however victory favors us 
as i believe and may the gods confirm it 
i wont make italians bend to trojans 
or seize power let both peoples strike 
a timeless treaty equal laws for two free nations 
ill give you gods and rites latinus father to 
my wife will keep his throne and army trojan 
hands will build a town named for lavinia 
next latinus spoke he looked up at the sky 
his right hand lifted to the stars aeneas 
i swear by the selfsame land same sea and stars 
by latonas double brood and twofaced janus 
by the hellgods power the shrines of ruthless dis 
hear me father you who bind pacts by your thunder 
i grasp your altar and i swear amid these flames 
and holy forces italy will never break 
this pact of peace whatever comes to pass 
no force will bend my will not even if 
it pours the flooded earth into the sea and heaven 
into helljust as this scepter in his hand 
hacked off in the forest orphaned from its mother 
its leaves and twigs lost to the knife will never 
pour out tender shoots or shade though it was 
a branch until the craftsman wrapped it in wrought bronze 
and gave it to the latin lords to carry 
with such words they sealed the pact as all the nobles 
watched then they slaughtered sacrificial 
animals over the flames ripping out live 
entrails and piled the altars with the heavy plates 
but the rutulians had long since thought the duel 
unfair they felt a tumult of emotions 
still more when they saw the unmatched fighters close 
still more when they saw turnus step silently 
up to the altar eyes downcast as he prayed 
his face so young his youthful body pale 
when juturna saw more people muttering 
the crowd wavering and losing heart 
she rushed among the soldiers taking on camertus 
formhis ancestors were a great clan 
his fathers name was linked with valor he himself 
was fiercest in the fightknowing well 
what she must do and planting different rumors 
for shame rutulians youd risk one life for all 
of us arent we matched in strength and numbers 
see what the trojans and arcadians amount to 
plus the doomed etrurians who dare to take on 
turnus our enemys too few for half of us 
turnus goes in glory to the gods whose altars 
hell exalt in death hell live on the lips 
of men but we our country lost will have to 
serve proud masters we who idle on these fields 
more and more her words inflamed the men 
a murmur started snaking through the ranks 
and the very latins and laurentians 
whod hoped for peace and rest from battle 
now once more wanted war and wished the pact 
would fail they pitied turnus sorry fate 
juturna added a still greater spur 
she showed an omen in the sky perfect 
to muddle and mislead italian minds 
joves tawny eagle flying in the ruddy light 
was bothering the shorebirds a large and noisy 
flock suddenly he plunged toward the water 
his vicious talons seized the noblest swan 
the italians took note as all the birds 
wheeled round in raucous flight an amazing 
sight darkening the sky with wings chasing 
the eagle through the air until done in 
by pressure and his heavy prey he dropped the swan 
into the stream and vanished in the clouds 
the rutulians hailed the omen with great shouts 
and prepared to arm tolumnius the augur 
was the first to speak ive prayed for this so often 
i accept the divine sign take up your swords 
and follow me poor countrymen whom that foreign 
pirate preys on like an eagle as he sacks 
your shores he too will soon fly off sailing for 
deep ocean one resolve for all close up 
your ranks and fight to save your deposed king 
he hurled his spear and charged the enemy 
the wellaimed cornel shaft sang out whistling as it 
cut the air at once a mighty roar rose up 
chaos in the ranks as all hearts boiled in tumult 
it happened that nine handsome brothers stood right 
in the spears path the sons faithful tyrrhena 
had borne gylippus of arcadia it struck 
one at the waist where the leather swordbelt 
chafed his stomach and the ends were pinned 
this beautiful young man so bright in his armor 
the weapon split his ribs and splayed him on the sand 
his brothers a brave phalanx fired by grief 
drew their swords or grabbed their iron spears 
and blindly rushed ahead the laurentians charged 
then in response rushed in a flood of trojans 
agyllines arcadians in painted armor 
all felt the same desire to let the sword decide 
the altars were stripped of kindling a thick storm 
of spears filled the sky a pelting iron rain 
winebowls and firepans were raided latinus 
fled with his failed gods and broken pact 
men harnessed chariots or vaulted onto horses 
swords bared ready to fight messapus keen to 
end the treaty drove his horse at terrified 
aulestes an etruscan king decked in a kings 
regalia as he quickly backed away 
the poor man tripped over an altar falling on 
his head and back fierce messapus flew in 
on his great horse his spear in hand as the king 
babbled in prayer he struck him dead and said 
hes done heres a better offering to the gods 
italians ran to loot the stillwarm corpse but 
corynaeus stormed them with a smoking altarbranch then ebysus charged in to stab him 
the flaming branch thrust in his face set fire to 
his beard which gave off a scorched smell corynaeus 
grabbed his frantic victims hair in his left hand 
kneed him to pin him down and sank his vicious 
blade into his side next podalirius 
chased the shepherd alsus as he fled among 
the front lines swords but as he raised his naked blade 
alsus heaved his ax at him and split his head 
down to his chin spurting blood soaked all his armor 
iron sleep and cruel silence pressed upon 
his eyes their brightness buried in eternal night 
pious aeneas head bared for the ritual 
stretched out unarmed hands and shouted to his men 
whats this attack how can battle start again 
control yourselves the treaty has been struck all 
the terms are set the right to fight is mine alone 
let me do it dont feel fear ill confirm 
the pact by my own hand our rites owe me turnus 
but as he spoke these words a hissing arrow 
sliced the air toward him no one knows 
whose bowstring whirled it home who brought 
the rutulians this honor a god or chance 
the great glory of the act was stifled 
no one boasted of aeneas wound 
when turnus saw aeneas yield saw his captains 
at a loss he burned with sudden eager hope 
calling for his armor and his team he proudly 
leapt into his chariot and took the reins 
he raced along the ranks sending many brave men 
down to death crushing others halfalive 
under his wheels grabbing spears to throw at those 
who ran he resembled bloodsoaked mars 
in action when he clangs his shield by icy hebrus 
to start a war and drives his frothing horses through 
the empty plain faster than the winds from west 
and south thrace groans under pounding hooves 
by mars ride pitchblack terror rage and treachery 
with such fervor turnus lashed his steaming 
sweaty team in the center of the skirmish trampling 
the defenseless dead the racing hooves sprayed 
crimson dew throwing up the bloodsoaked sand 
he killed sthenelus then thamyrus and pholus 
the last two handtohand the first speared through he killed 
glaucus and his brother lades imbrasus sons 
raised by him in lycia they had the same weapons 
fit for combat or to race the winds on horseback 
in another part eumedes rode to battle 
old dolons son renowned in war his name was 
from his grandfather but his strength and courage 
were his fatherswho once dared to claim achilles 
chariot as a prize for scouting the greek camp 
but diomedes paid him in a different coin 
he no longer hopes to win achilles team 
turnus saw him far away across the open 
plain and transfixed him with a flying lance 
he flew up and leapt down from his chariot 
tall over the trojan dying on the ground 
then planted his foot on his neck and wrenched away 
the mans own sword he dyed the bright blade ruddy in 
eumedes throat see the fields of italy 
you fought to winlie there now and measure them 
such are the prized city walls for those who cross me 
he speared asbytes to keep eumedes company 
and chloreus thersilochus sybaris 
dares thymoetes just thrown from his horse 
as the thracian north wind howls over 
the deep aegean chasing waves to shore 
gusts buffet the sea clouds scuttle from the sky 
so the ranks fell back where turnus cut a path 
and columns turned and fled his momentum 
carried him his crest shook in the airstream 
phegeus would have none of this attack 
these roars flinging himself at the chariot 
he pulled aside the bolting horses foaming bridles 
as he hung there dragged alongside turnus stabbed 
his bare flank with a broadtipped lance that pierced 
the twoply chain mail the lance stuck in the shallow wound 
phegeus turned to block him with his shield 
pulling out his sword in selfdefense but 
the wheel and spinning axle threw him to the ground 
with his sword turnus struck his head off 
between the helmet and the breastplates upper edge 
and left the headless body on the sand 
while turnus dealt relentless death across the plain 
mnestheus staunch achates and ascanius 
brought aeneas into camp he was bleeding leaning 
on his lengthy spear with every other step 
and furious he struggled to rip out 
the broken arrow shouting for the easiest 
solution to cut the wound wide open with a sword 
and find the buried arrowhead then go back 
to battle now ipyx isus son arrived apollos 
favorite once in passions painful grip 
the god had offered ipyx his own skills and talent 
augury the lyre and flying archery 
but to stall his ailing fathers death ipyx 
chose to learn the use of herbs and medicine 
to practice silent arts that brought no glory 
aeneas leaned on his huge spear grumbling 
bitterly a throng of soldiers crowded round him 
as ilus grieved he ignored their tears old 
ipyx hitched his cloak and tunic as healers do 
quickly he applied apollos potent herbs 
and potions nothing worked not tugging at the arrow 
with his hand not clamping on the iron head 
with a forceps grip fortune and the god 
offered no help and meanwhile battles horror crept 
across the plain so close they could see a wall 
of dust as the cavalry approached arrows 
rained into the camp the awful screams of men 
who fought and fell in the hard combat rose to sky 
then venus distressed at her childs undeserved pain 
plucked sprigs of dittany from cretan ida 
a plant of purple blooms and downy leaves 
not unknown to wild goats struck in the side 
by flying arrows she fetched it her face shrouded 
in thick mist and made a secret potion steeping 
the stems in a gleaming bowl of water 
adding an elixir of healing ambrosia 
and fragrant panacea aged ipyx soothed 
the wound using this brew without knowing 
at once all pain left aeneas body 
and the bleeding in the wound was stanched 
now the arrow came out freely when he pulled 
new strength restored aeneas to his former state 
the first to fire their hearts against the enemy 
ipyx shouted hurry bring the man his weapons 
dont just stand there aeneas no human art 
or doctors skill cured you nor did my hand 
a great god did he sends you to greater work 
eager to fight angry at lost time aeneas 
sheathed his calves right and left in golden 
greaves and took up spear sword and breastplate 
he clasped ascanius with chainmailed arms 
kissed him lightly through the visor and said 
son learn bravery and real work from me 
from others luck my right hand is your 
defense it will lead you to great prizes 
make sure to be mindful when you are a man 
of the models that your family left i 
and your mothers brother hector should inspire you 
with these words he left the gate a great figure 
wielding a great spear mnestheus and 
antheus and a dense throng marched with him 
the reserves all left the camp as well 
the plain trembled under tramping feet as blinding 
dust rose up from the rampart turnus saw them 
as they came the ausonians saw too 
and felt an icy shiver juturna heard and knew 
the sound before the latins did she fled 
afraid as aeneas raced across the open 
field with his dark troops like a storm breaking 
at sea whose thunderheads approach the shore 
as howling winds precede them foreboding fills 
the wretched farmers hearts for the storm will blast 
their trees and crops destroying everything 
just so the trojan leader drove his men against 
the enemy their columns closepacked round him 
thymbraeus killed great osiris with his sword 
mnestheus killed arcetius achates killed 
epulo gyas killed ufens tolumnius 
the augur fell the first to throw his spear 
shouts rose to the sky and the rutulians 
routed in turn ran across the dusty fields 
aeneas didnt stoop to killing fugitives 
nor those he met on foot nor horsemen holding lances 
through clouds of dust he tracked only one man 
his challenge was for one alone turnus 
at this juturna numb with fear became 
a warrior she heaved metiscus turnus driver 
from the reins and he fell hitting the beam 
leaving him behind she took his post his voice 
his form and armor pulling on the reins to swerve 
like a dusky swallow flying round the halls 
of some rich lord circling the high rooms in flight 
gathering tidbits for her cheeping fledglings 
as she flutters through the empty porticoes 
or by the wet rain gutters so juturna 
veered through the enemies and all the plain 
in her rapid chariot now here now there 
she granted glimpses of proud turnus but steered him 
far away avoiding conflict aeneas tracked 
her twisting course chasing turnus calling for him 
loudly through the scattered ranks but every time 
he spotted him and ran toward the racing horses 
juturna turned the chariot aside 
what could he do he was carried on a sea 
of thoughts none useful his cares pulled at him 
messapus approached stealthy on his feet 
two spears in his hand each tipped with iron 
he threw one with unerring force aeneas stopped 
and crouched behind his shield dropping to one knee 
but the flying spear still sliced off his helmets 
crested peak then he saw turnus chariot 
eluding him again and fresh anger at 
italian treachery rose up in him calling 
jove to witness and the altars of the broken 
treaty he plunged into the heart of battle 
with mars on his side now he killed at random 
terrifying as he let his rage run free 
what god can help me sing of so much horror 
the great slaughter and slain generals the men 
whom turnus then the trojan hero drove over 
the plain jupiter did you want nations fated 
for eternal peace to clash so violently 
rutulian sucro didnt keep aeneas long 
he stabbed sucro in the side the first fight 
to slow the trojan rush and pushed the hard blade 
through the ribs that hold the heart an instant death 
turnus unhorsed amycus and his brother 
diores he hit one with his lengthy lance 
as he approached then the other with his sword 
and hung both severed heads dripping blood from 
his chariot aeneas sent tanas talos 
and brave cethegus to death three at once 
and sad onites peridias theban son 
turnus killed the brothers from apollos lycian 
fields then menoetes of arcadia 
whose aversion to war was no use hed fished 
lernas fertile streams his pauper home unknown 
to patrons his father farmed on rented fields 
like fires set in arid woods from facing sides 
racing through the crackling laurels like foaming rivers 
roaring as they crash down mighty mountains 
in their rushing course blasting open 
their own channels as they run into the sea 
so turnus and aeneas tore through the lines 
rage boiled in them both without restraint hearts 
bursting they used all their strength for slaughter 
as murranus bragged of ancestors and ancient 
names all his race back to the latin kings 
aeneas whirled a giant rock and smashed him 
to the ground under the yoke and reins the wheels 
rolled him forward and his horses careless of 
their master trampled him with thudding hooves 
hyllus charged with a huge roar turnus threw 
a spear at that goldclad head the weapon pierced 
his helmet and lodged in his brain cretheus 
strongest of the greeks your strength didnt ward off 
turnus cupencus your gods didnt save you 
from aeneas as the spear hit your chest 
your bronze shield offered one poor second of delay 
aeolus laurentian fields saw you die too 
you sprawled across the soil on your back 
you whom argive phalanxes had failed to kill 
and achilles though he toppled priams kingdom 
here was deaths finish line your noble home 
was near ida in lyrnesus but your grave 
was in laurentian earth now all the lines wheeled round 
the latins trojans fierce serestus and mnestheus 
messapus the horsetamer and brave asilas 
the tuscan legion and evanders arcadians 
it was each man for himself with all he had 
there was no pause no rest in the ravages of war 
and now his lovely mother put a notion 
in aeneas head that he should hurl his army 
at the city walls and stun the latins 
with this new calamity tracking turnus 
he gazed around and saw the town untouched 
by the huge war immune the thought of greater 
stakes enflamed him he called to him the chiefs 
mnestheus brave serestus and sergestus 
and stepped up on a mound the trojan legions 
ringed it not setting down their shields or spears 
from the center he cried jupiter stands with us 
let my orders meet with no delay even 
if this strategy is new no holding back 
today ill storm the town thats caused the war latinus 
capital and raze its smoking rooftops to 
the ground unless they surrender and submit 
should i wait till turnus deigns to fight 
with mea man ive beaten once before 
citizens this is the source and sum of unjust war 
bring torches quickly well reclaim the treaty 
with our flames all of them with eager effort 
made a wedge formation the dense mass stormed 
the walls ladders torches suddenly appeared 
some ran to kill the sentries at the gates 
others showered spears the sky was dark with weapons 
aeneas himself in the front and by the walls 
raised his right hand and denounced latinus loudly 
swearing by the gods that he was forced to war 
again italians again had broken faith 
turned foe discord broke out in the trembling town 
some wanted to fling the gates wide open to 
the trojans and drag the king up to the walls 
some rushed to guard the ramparts with their weapons 
just like bees when a shepherd tracks them 
to a porous rock and fills it with harsh smoke 
disturbed they scurry round their waxy camp 
sharpening their outrage with loud buzzes 
as the black stench fills their home the rock 
resounds with humming smoke coils in the clear sky 
now a new misfortune struck the weary latins 
one that shook the city to its core with grief 
when the queen at home saw the enemy 
approach saw the walls attacked torches flying 
at the roofs no rutulians defending 
none of turnus troops the unhappy woman 
thought hed died in combat pierced by sudden grief 
she cried she was the cause and culmination 
of their pain speaking wildly in despair 
and set on death she tore her purple robe 
and hung a noose around a beaman ugly end 
when the wretched latin women heard this news 
first lavinia tore her golden hair and gouged 
her rosy cheeks then the group around her 
insane with grief the palace echoed their lament 
from here the tragic rumor spread across the city 
all hearts sank latinus tore his clothing 
stunned by his wifes death and his towns ruin 
fouling his white hair with filthy dirt 
meanwhile fierce turnus at the edge of battle 
still followed some stragglers but more slowly 
his horses skill now pleased him less and less 
on the wind came shouts of unseen horror 
he listened to the ominous low rumbles 
sounds of a city in distress and cried 
what great grief disturbs our walls whats this 
uproar coming to us all the way from town 
with these words he seized the reins frantic to stop 
but his sister posing as the charioteer 
metiscus still steering team and chariot 
countered this way turnus lets pursue 
the trojansweve found victory on this path 
there are others to defend the walls by force 
aeneas is attacking the italians 
we can inflict brutal deaths on trojans 
you wont leave the battle his inferior 
in honor or men killed turnus answered 
sister i knew you long ago when you ruined 
the treaty with your wiles and joined the fight 
you dont deceive me goddess but who wanted you 
to leave olympus and endure these efforts 
was it to see your luckless brothers brutal death 
what should i do how can fortune save me 
murranus died before my eyes calling out 
my name a great fighter he fell to a great 
wound no one i love equally still lives 
unlucky ufens perished so he wouldnt see 
my shame the trojans have his armor and his corpse 
should i let our homes be razed all thats left 
and not silence drances insults by the sword 
should i turn tail and let this land see turnus 
run away is death so dreadful smile on me 
shades of the dead since the gods are hostile my soul 
descends to you unmarred by cowardice ive never 
been unworthy of my noble ancestors 
and now saces galloped through the fighting 
his horse foaming himself wounded by an arrow 
to the face he begged turnus as he passed 
youre our last hope turnus pity your people 
aeneas thunders in his armor threatening 
to raze our citadel and ruin us all 
already burning torches land upon our roofs 
we look to you king latinus is still muttering 
about whom to call his soninlaw which pact 
to pick as for the queen who loved you most 
shes killed herself in fear and left the light of day 
messapus and brave atinas stand alone 
before the gates and hold the line legions press them 
all around a dense and spiky crop of swords 
still you drive in circles on the empty grass 
the image of these losses staggered turnus 
silent he stood and stared his heart seethed with 
mixed emotions shame and grief mingled with madness 
love driven by fury and selfconscious courage 
when he shook the shadows from his mind 
and could see clearly he turned his burning eyes toward 
the walls and city from his chariot aghast 
a spiral flame was rolling up a towers stories 
billowing to sky eating the whole structure 
a tower he himself had built with jointed beams 
set on wheels and fitted with high walkways 
sister fate has won stop delaying me 
lets go where jove and heartless fortune call 
im resolved to fight aeneas and ready 
for death even if its bitterno more disgrace 
just let me rage this final bout of rage 
leaping from his chariot he bolted through 
the hostile swords deserting his sad sister 
and burst into the center of the fighting 
just as a rock uprooted by the wind will tumble 
down a mountainside after violent rain 
or passing years have weakened its grip 
flying down the sheer slope the ruthless boulder 
bounds over the ground bowling over trees 
and herds and men so turnus flung apart the ranks 
racing to the city walls there the earth 
was soaked with blood spears whistled through the air 
he raised his arm to signal shouting loudly 
rutulians now stop latins hold your weapons 
the plans of fate are meant for me its right 
that i pay for the broken pact alone my sword 
will decide all pulled back and left a space 
but when father aeneas heard turnus name 
he left the walls and towers breaking off from 
all wars worknot a moment of delay 
exultant he clanged his weapons grimly 
looming like mount athos or mount eryx 
or father apennine as he soars skyward joyous 
when gusts rustle oak trees on his snowy peak 
now they all turned eagerly to watch 
rutulians trojans and italians men on 
the high ramparts men with batteringrams below 
they all put down their shields even latinus 
was stunned to see great men from distant points on earth 
meet and clash with swords a contest to end war 
when a level space was clear on the field 
they hurled their spears and ran toward each other 
bronze shield hit bronze shield and the fight began 
the earth groaned as the two men rained down swordstrokes 
blow on blow chance and courage in the mix 
like two bulls butting heads in mortal combat 
on huge sila or taburnus heights 
the cowhands retreat in fear and the herd 
waits silently the heifers wonder who will 
rule the forest who will lead the herds 
the bulls trade wounds with brutal violence 
locking horns goring flesh splashing blood 
across their shoulders as the woods echo their grunts 
just so trojan aeneas and the daunian hero 
clashed with shields a huge din filled the air 
jupiter himself balanced a scale 
and put the two lives in the pans to see 
whose acts were doomed whose weight plunged down to death 
turnus sprang forward seeing a safe chance 
he surged to his full height raised his sword 
and struck the trojans and the latins cried out 
anxiously on edge but the faithless blade 
snapped off and failed him his only recourse was 
to run seeing the strange hilt in his defenseless 
hand he fled faster than the eastern wind 
they say that when he climbed into the chariot 
for battle in his haste he left his fathers sword 
and grabbed metiscuss instead it served 
him all the while he chased the straggling trojans 
but when it came to vulcans divine weapons 
the mortal blade shattered like brittle glass 
its fragments glinting on the yellow sand 
desperate turnus looked for any way to get 
away tracing confused circles in the field 
but the mass of trojans shut him in all round 
and here a huge marsh stopped him there high walls 
aeneas too though troubled by his knees 
the wound slowed them down it was hard to run 
pressed his frantic enemy step for step 
like a hunting dog whose barks threaten 
a stag trapped by a stream or feathered cordon 
fearful of the bank and snares the stag wheels round 
a thousand times but the nimble umbrian 
hound pursues him closely mouth agape 
he thinks he has him any moment now 
and bites but his jaws snap shut on empty air 
now shouts rose up in earnest the banks and lakes 
echoed the sound the whole sky thundered with 
the din as he ran turnus chided all 
his men by name demanding his own sword 
while aeneas vowed instant death to anyone 
who helped and terrified the trembling enemy 
with threats to raze the city he pressed on though wounded 
they raced five full circuits and five in reverse 
this way and that since they sought no small or paltry 
prize but vied for turnus life and blood 
an olive tree with bitter leaves once grew there 
holy to faunus and revered in the old days 
by sailors saved from seawrecks on it they nailed 
gifts to the laurentian god and hung their votive 
clothing but the trojans had chopped down the tree 
without a thought so they could fight on open ground 
here stood aeneas spear wedged into 
the stubborn roots by the force with which it flew 
the trojan bent to wrench it free hed use 
the spear to strike the prey he couldnt catch 
on foot then turnus cried out wild with fear 
faunus please have pity and you kind earth 
hold fast that spear if i ever kept your rites 
which aeneas men have profaned in their war 
he didnt pray for the gods help in vain 
aeneas though he struggled long and hard 
over the stubborn stump could not pry apart 
its wooden grip despite his strength while he strained 
juturna again appearing as the driver 
metiscus dashed up to give turnus his sword 
venus outraged at the nymphs audacity 
came and pulled aeneas spear from the roots 
spirits soaring both men rearmed one trusting 
to his sword one tall and fierce with his spear 
they faced each other panting in the toil of war 
now the king of great olympus said to juno 
as she watched the battle from a golden cloud 
wife what will be the end of this whats left 
you yourself admit aeneas will reach 
the stars and rise to heaven as the nations god 
whats your plan what hope keeps you in chill clouds 
a mortal man wounded a god was that right 
or that turnus got his sword i know you helped 
juturna and the losers have new strength 
stop at last and be persuaded by my prayers 
dont let silent grief consume you dont make me 
hear again your sweet mouth utter sad concerns 
its over you harassed the trojans across 
land and sea you ignited awful wars 
you ruined a home and mingled grief and marriage 
i forbid you to do more so he spoke 
juno answered with bowed head i knew 
your will great jupiter thats why i left 
the earth and turnus i didnt want to otherwise 
you wouldnt see me sitting in a cloud alone 
enduring everything id be in the front lines 
ringed with flames id drag the trojans into battle 
its true i told juturna she could help 
her distressed brother and dare more for his life 
but not to use her bow and arrow i swear it 
by the river styxs unforgiving source 
the only oath revered by the upper gods 
now ill yield and leave this loathsome war 
but i beg one thing not forbidden by fates 
laws for latium and the glory of your 
latin kin when theres peace and wedding 
celebrations when they join in laws and pacts 
dont command the latins on their native soil 
to change their name to teucrians becoming 
trojans or to change their clothes and speech 
let latium and alban kings last through the ages 
let romes children triumph with italian courage 
troy perished let her name perish as well 
the maker of all men and matter smiled and said 
truly youre joves sister and a child of saturn 
such waves of anger surge inside your heart 
come now give up this rage you honed for nothing 
i grant your wish and willingly youve won 
the ausonians will keep their fathers speech 
customs and name the trojans will subside into 
mixed stock ill add trojan rites to local ones 
theyll all be latins with one language 
youll see a race arise from their mixed blood 
that will surpass both gods and men in piety 
no other race will pay you so much honor 
agreeing to these terms juno turned her mind 
to happiness she quit her cloud and left the sky 
this done the father pondered a new problem 
how to drive juturna from her brothers side 
men say there are twin plagues called furies daughters of 
the dead of night born with hellish megaera 
night wrapped them all in serpent coils and added 
windswift wings they serve before joves throne 
on the threshold of the savage king and whet 
the terror of weak humankind any time 
the king of gods devises vile death and disease 
or terrifies a guilty town with war 
he told one to hurry from the sky 
and cross juturnas path an evil omen 
a rapid whirlwind carried her to earth 
like an arrow springing from a bow parthian 
or cydonian that races through the clouds 
carrying venom a wound beyond curing 
crossing the swift shadows hissing and unseen 
so rushed the child of night heading for earth 
when she saw the trojan lines and turnus troops 
she quickly took the shape of a small owl 
that sits on tombs and lonely rooftops late at night 
and hoots her eerie notes among the shadows 
the monster fluttered around turnus face 
screeching her wings beating at his shield 
a strange numbness left him weak with dread 
his hair stood up in horror his voice choked in his throat 
turnus unhappy sister knew the furys shrilling 
wings from far she tore her hair and gouged her face 
with fingernails pounded on her chest with fists 
turnus how can your sister help you now 
should i give up heartlessly but what skill 
of mine could stall your death i cant fight a fury 
ill go ill leave the battle vile bird dont scare me 
im afraid already i know the deadly drumming 
of your wings great joves proud commands 
are clear is this my virginitys reward 
why give me immortality why cant i die 
as humans do then i could end this crushing grief 
and follow my sad brother to the shades 
immortal life is worthless what will bring me pleasure 
without you what earth can gape open so deeply 
as to send a goddess to the shades below 
she said this groaning deeply then draped her head 
in graygreen robes and plunged deep in the river 
aeneas was in pursuit he shook his massive spear 
almost a tree and spoke these savage words 
whats the delay now turnus why retreat 
this contest is a duel not a race 
go on change yourself to any shape gather 
all your strength and skill such as you have chase 
the stars on wings hide yourself in earths deep 
hollows turnus shook his head fierce aeneas 
your hot words dont scare me its the gods i fear 
and joves enmity he looked around and saw 
a giant rock an ancient giant rock set in the plain 
a boundary mark for conflicts over land 
hardly twelve men could lift it on their shoulders 
such men as earth produces now but the hero 
grabbed it in his hands and rose then ran 
toward his enemy and heaved the rock at him 
but even as he ran even as he raised and 
threw the giant boulder he didnt feel like turnus 
to himself his knees couldnt hold him fear chilled 
his blood his rock tumbling through the empty air 
didnt bridge the gap didnt reach its goal 
it was like a dream when drowsy sleep lies on 
our eyes we feel were trying to run but somehow 
its no use we collapse weakly as we try 
the strength we know is gone we cannot speak 
no words or sounds come out just so the awful goddess 
kept turnus from success despite his bravery 
then mixed emotions churned inside his heart 
he hung back in dread and gazed at the rutulians 
and the city trembling at his coming death 
there was no place to run no strength to fight 
no chariot to see no charioteer no sister 
as turnus faltered aeneas saw his chance 
raising his fatal spear he put all his body 
in the throw no stone hurled from a siege engine 
ever roared so loudly no clap of thunder ever 
crashed like this the spear flew a black tornado 
bringing dreadful death hissing it tore through 
the breastplates border and the outer circle of 
the sevenlayered shield and ran right through his thigh 
his legs folded and huge turnus crumpled 
to the ground the rutulians leapt up groaning 
the hills and forests echoed their cry far and wide 
humbly turnus raised his eyes his hands 
and begged i deserve this i dont ask for mercy 
use your chance but if a parents grief can touch you 
have pity for old daunus you had such a father 
in anchises and return me to my people 
as a corpse if you prefer youve won 
the ausonians have seen me stretch my hands out 
in defeat lavinias yours dont press your hatred 
further fierce aeneas stood there armed his eyes 
roaming restlessly holding back the deathblow 
and now more and more turnus words began 
to move him and he hesitatedwhen high on turnus 
shoulder he saw the fatal swordbelt of young pallas 
the strap flashing with its wellknown studspallas 
whom turnus killed when down and took that emblem 
of the enemy to wear upon his shoulder 
aeneas drank in this reminder of his savage 
grief ablaze with rage awful in anger he cried 
should i let you slip away wearing what you 
tore from one i loved pallas sacrifices 
you pallas punishes your profane bloodand 
seething planted his sword in that hostile heart 
turnus knees buckled with chill his soul fled 
with a groan of protest to the shades below
