BOOK 1


My song is of war and a man a refugee by fate
the first from Troy to Italys Lavinian shores
battered much on land and sea by blows from gods
obliging brutal Junos unforgetting rage
he suffered much in war as well all to plant
his town and gods in Latium From here would rise
the Latin race the Alban lords and Romes high walls
Remember for me Muse Tell me the reasons What pain
what insult to her power moved the queen of gods
10 to drive a man famous for piety through misery
on misery Can such anger grip gods minds
An ancient city built by colonists from Tyre
faced Italy and Tibers mouth across the sea
wealthy Carthage fierce and fond of waging war
They say that Juno loved her best even Samos
came in second Here the goddess kept her weapons
and her chariot this land would rule the world
if fate allowed This was her aim and hope
But shed heard that men of Trojan blood
20 would topple Carthage and her heights one day
Theyd be a people proud in war an empire
51

fatal for her Libya This was what the Fates had
spun this was Junos fear She remembered
how shed fought at Troy to help her cherished Greeks
Still other reasons for her rage and bile
remained deeprooted in her heart Paris scornful
verdict on her beauty the honors paid by Jove
to kidnapped Ganymede her hatred for that race
Enflamed by this she barred from Latium
30 the seatossed Trojans the few left by the Greeks
and cruel Achilles They roamed for many years
over many oceans forced on by the Fates
To found the Roman race required such great effort
Sicily had slipped from sight The Trojans gladly
sailed for open sea their bronze prows churning foam
But Juno nursing her eternal wound thought
to herself Am I to leave off from my plan
and fail to turn the Trojan king from Italy
It seems that Fate forbids it Then how could Pallas
40 burn the Argive fleet and drown its crew just to
punish the mad crime of Ajax son of Oleus
On her own she hurled Joves lightning from the clouds
wrecked the ships and whipped up waves with wind
she grabbed up Ajax in a gust and spiked him on sharp
reefsthe man puffed fire from his punctured chest
But me the queen of all the gods Joves wife
and sister too for years Ive had to fight
against a single race Now wholl worship me
or put gifts on my altars as a supplicant
50 Her hot heart fixed on these thoughts Queen Juno reached

52

Aeolia a land that teemed with storms and clouds
In his colossal cave King Aeolus
ruled the warring winds and howling gales
and locked them up inside They roared around the latches
outraged Over them the mountain murmured
mightily Aeolus sitting in his stronghold
scepter in his hand soothed their angry spirits
Otherwise theyd seize the oceans lands
and deepest sky and blast them all away
60 It was this fear that made the mighty Father
hide them in a lightless cave and heap mountains
on top He chose a king who swore hed curb
the winds or free their reins as he was told
Now Juno came to wheedle him Aeolus
the father of the gods and king of men
chose you to calm the waves or whip them up with wind
A race I hate travels the Tuscan sea
they bring the beaten gods of Troy to Italy
Rouse the winds to galeforce sink the ships
70 or scatter them and fling the crew into the sea
In my retinue are fourteen gorgeous nymphs
Deiopea is the loveliest of all Shes yours
just do me this favor Ill join you both
in lasting marriage so shell spend her years
with you and make you father to fair children
Aeolus said Your task O Queen is to know
your wish and will mine to make it happen
Thanks to you I have this little kingdom
and Jupiters goodwill I dine with gods
80 Im master of the storms and wild weather
53

Saying this he struck the hollow mountain
with the buttend of his spear A battleline
of winds rushed out the rift and swept over the lands
Notus Eurus and Africus full of storms
settled on the sea as one and churned it
from its bed they rolled huge waves to shore
Next came the shouts of men the shriek of ropes
At once stormclouds snatched the sky from sight
Black night brooded on the sea The heavens
90 thundered frequent flashes tore the dark
All signs warned the men that death had come
At once Aeneas knees buckled with chill
He groaned and held up both hands to the stars
Three and four times fortunate all you who died
by Troys high walls under your fathers gaze
O Diomedes bravest of the Greeks
I wish Id fallen on Troys fields my blood spilled
by your strong right hand where fierce Hector perished
on Achilles spear and huge Sarpedon too
100 where Simos rolls in its stream so many shields
and helmets so many bodies of the brave
As he spoke the howling north wind hit the sails
headon and pushed the sea up to the stars
The oars snapped and the ship swung broadside
to the waves a wall of water crashed on deck
Some sailors hung on crests some saw seabed
as each wave loomed up The sea boiled with sand
Notus snatched three ships and hurled them onto reefs
that lurked midsea the ones Italians call Altars
54

110 huge spines near the surface Eurus drove

three boats into the shoals a sorry sight and smashed
them on the rocks Sand built up around them
Before Aeneas eyes a giant wave broke on
the ship of good Orontes and his Lycians
It threw the helmsman off the deck headfirst into
wild waters Eddies spun the ship around
three times then the raging undertow engulfed it
A few men surfaced in the vast abyss Weapons
planks and Trojan treasure floated in the waves
120 The storm seized Ilioneus sturdy ship
brave Achates ship Abas ship and old
Aletes ship They all let in fatal water
through the hulls loose seams and gaping cracks
Now Neptune sensed the seas chaos and clamor
the storm Aeolus sent He felt the churning
of the sluggish waters of the deep Perplexed
he raised his peaceful face and scanned the sea
He saw Aeneas wavetossed ships the Trojans
swamped by swells and the ruin of the sky
130 Junos angry treachery was clear to him
He called Eurus and Zephyrus and said to them
Is it your noble birth that makes you bold
You winds now dare to mingle sky and earth
and stir up waves without permission Why
I shouldBut first Ill soothe the wild sea Then
youll get what you deserve and it wont be in words
Get out of here now and tell your king
rule over the sea and savage tridents mine
55

by lot not his His kingdom is the cave
140 where you live Eurus Let him strut in that court
and rule thereonce his winds are jailed
Faster than his words Neptune soothed the swells
routed huddled clouds brought back the sun
Cymothoe and Triton pried the ships off crags
Neptune helped them with his trident He cleared
pathways through long shoals and calmed the sea
skimming wavecrests lightly in his chariot
Just as riots often fester in great crowds
when the common mob goes mad rocks and
150 firebrands fly the weapons rage supplies
but if they see a man of weight in piety
and service they hush and wait to hear him
he guides their minds and soothes their hearts with words
just so all the tumult of the sea died down
once Neptune scanned the waters He turned his team
and let them run free under cloudless skies
Aeneas tired crew fights to reach the nearest
shore they bend toward the Libyan coast
There an islands deep bay forms a harbor
160 with its sides Every wave from the high sea
is broken here and fans out to the curving coves
On both sides sheer cliffs and matching crags
menace the sky but underneath safe pools
lie wide and still Above a rustling forest
sets the scene dark with trembling shade
A cave with rocky overhangs faces the front
It has freshwater pools and stones for seats
56

the home of nymphs Here no cables tie
the weary boats no anchor bites the sand
170 Aeneas enters with his ships seven
left from all the fleet With great love for land
the Trojans reach the shore they craved disembark
and rest their sodden limbs on sand Achates
is the first to strike a spark from flint
He kindles fire with leaves and sets dry fodder
on the flames then feeds the blaze with twigs
Weary from their wandering they fetch the pots
and spoiled grain they rescued from the waves then dry
the food with fire and crush it under stone
180 Meanwhile Aeneas scales a cliff and scans

the spread of ocean wondering if hed perhaps see
some Trojan ships seatossed Antheus Capys
or Caicus shield attached to a high stern
Theres no ship in sight but three stags stray
along the shore Behind them come whole herds
of deer the long line grazing through the gorge
He stops and grabs his bow and flying shafts
the weapons loyal Achates holds for him
First he drops the leading stags whose antlers
190 branch on heads held high Then he drives
the panicked herd all through the leafy woods
He only stops after hes vanquished seven
massive beasts the number of his ships
Back at port he splits the meat among his crew
and shares the wine which kind Acestes poured
in heavy jars when they left Sicily
a heros giftand comforts their sad hearts
57

My friends were no strangers to misfortune
Youve suffered worse some god will end this too
200 You slipped past savage Scylla and her crags that rang
with barks you saw the Cyclops rocks Be brave
let go your fear and despair Perhaps someday
even memory of this will bring you pleasure
Through good times and bad through many trials
we make for Latium There the fates
promise us rest there Troy must rise again
Hold on Save your strength for better days to come
So he says Though hes sick with crushing cares
he feigns hope on his face and clamps down his deep pain
210 They prepare the game their future feast
hacking hide from ribs laying bare the guts
Some slice the quivering meat to thread on spits
some set cauldrons on the shore and tend the fires
Sprawling on the grass they restore their strength
with food gorging on old wine and fatty game
Once their hungers sated and the dishes cleared
they ask after lost friends talking at length
wavering between hope and fearare they alive
or have they met their end now deaf to any calls
220 Pious Aeneas grieves the most but secretly
for keen Orontes fate for Amycus for Lycus
cruel death for brave Gyas brave Cloanthus
Now their grief was done Jupiter looked down
from heavens height onto the sailswept sea
the lands and shores and farflung folk From his
lofty seat he fixed his gaze on Libya
58

And as he dwelled on his concerns sad Venus
her eyes wet with shiny tears came to him
You who rule the lives of gods and men
230 a terror with your thunderbolts what did
my Aeneas and the Trojansso many
dead alreadyever do to you All lands
are closed to them on Italys account
You promised once that theyd give rise to Romans
that in the circling years leaders would rise
from Teucers blood to rule the land and sea
Father what made you change your mind This was
my consolation for Troys fall and tragic ruin
when I weighed one fate against the other
240 Now the same curse hounds them after all
their suffering Great king has their pain no end
Antenor could dodge the Greeks at Troy reach
Adriatic shores in safety and travel deep
into Liburnia He saw Timavus source
where the sea comes inland through nine paths
and bursts out noisily engulfing fields with surf
He founded Padua a home for Teucrians
gave his citizens a name and put away
his Trojan armor Now he lives in peace retired
250 But we your blood You promised us the heights of heaven
then betrayed us to a single females rage
Our ships are lost and were kept far from Italy
This is our prize for piety This our triumph

Smiling at her with the look that calms the sky
59

and storms the forefather of gods and men
gently kissed his daughter and replied
Let go your fear Cytherea Your peoples fate
remains unchanged youll see Lavinium and
its promised walls youll raise greatsouled Aeneas
260 to the stars I havent changed my mind
Since this worry gnaws at you Ill tell you more
and unroll the secrets of the fates Your son
will wage wide war in Italy subdue
ferocious tribes and give them walls and customs
After the Latins lose Aeneas will be king
in Latium three summers and three winters
His son Ascanius now called Ilus
he was Ilus during Iliums reign
will rule for thirty cycling years of cycling
270 months Hell move Laviniums seat of power
and strengthen Alba Longa with high walls
Here when Hectors line has ruled three hundred
years the priestess Ilia pregnant by Mars
will have his twins Romulus clad in his foster
mothers tawny wolfpelt will gladly lead
his people With Mars help hell build Romes
walls and name the Romans for himself
On them I set no boundaries of time or space
Ive granted empire without end Even cruel
280 Juno terror of the land and sea and sky
will change her plans and like me favor Romans
people of the toga rulers of the world
So Ive decreed As years slip by an age
will come when Assaracus house will conquer
Argos and crush Phthia and famed Mycenae
60

Trojan Caesar will be born of lovely Venus line
whose rule will reach all shores his fame the stars
Julius a name passed down from great Ilus
Freed from worry youll greet him in the skies
290 Hell come laden with Eastern spoils and men will pray
to him harsh centuries of war will cease
Ancient Trust and Vesta Remus and Quirinus
will set down laws the awful iron Gates of War
will close Inside impious Rage crouched on
brutal weapons tied up with a hundred knots
of bronze will roar from bloodstained jaws
Now Jupiter sent Mercury the son of Maia
to make sure the lands and citadel of Carthage
would greet the Trojans kindly and so Dido
300 blind to fate would not drive them off He flew
across the width of sky sweeping wings like oars
and soon reached Libya He did his task the people
quelled their fierce hearts the queen especially
took up a calm and kindly view of Trojans
Pious Aeneas worried greatly through the night
When gentle dawn appeared he decided to explore
this unknown land to find out where hed sailed
and learn who lived there animals or men
what he saw looked wild Then hed bring back news
310 He hid the fleet inside an inlet hemmed
by woods close to overhanging cliffs
among the quivering shade of trees Then he left
with two broadbladed spears Achates at his side

61

His mother met him in midforest with a young girls
face and dress She had weapons that a Spartan
girl might carry or Harpalyce of Thrace
who tires horses and outruns the rushing river
Hebrus Huntresslike shed slung a handy bow
across her back Her hair streamed on the wind
320 her knees were bare a knot held up her dresss folds
Meeting them she asked Young men did you
chance on any of my sisters roaming here
in a lynxs dappled hide holding a quiver
or shouting on the heels of a foaming boar
Venus son replied to her as follows
I havent seen or heard a trace of them
But how should I address you Your face and voice
do not seem mortal Goddessas you must be
are you Apollos sister Does nymphblood run in you
330 I hope that seeing you will ease our hardship
What skies are these where on earth have we washed up
Tell us We dont know this place or people
Were wanderers and driven by the winds and tides
My hand will offer many victims at your altars
But Venus said I dont deserve such honor
We Tyrian girls all sport a quiver we all tie
the laces of our purple boots high on our shins
You see a Punic colony Agenors men
But Libya unsubdued in battle borders us
340 Dido of Tyre is our queen she left her home
fleeing her own brother Its a long and complex
tale of wrong but heres the gist of it
62

Sychaeus Didos husband had more land
than any Tyrian Poor Dido loved him greatly
Her father married them when she was still a virgin
But Pygmalion her brothera prodigy
of evilwas the king Some mad feud estranged
the men and her impious brother blind with lust
for gold caught and killed Sychaeus at the altar
350 indifferent to his sisters love For long that swine
concealed his crime He tricked the heartsick wife
with empty hope and spun her many tales
But in her dreams her husbands ghost appeared to her
unburied raising his pale and eerie face
He showed her the cruel altar and his pierced
chest and told her of the evil hidden in their
home He urged her to depart their land at once
and revealed a treasure buried long ago
an unknown weight of gold and silverfor the trip
360 Shaken Dido planned escape selected friends
Those who loathed or feared the tyrant gathered
They seized whatever ships were ready loading them
with gold The riches that the greedy man had craved
voyaged the sea and a woman led the act
They reached this place where you now see great walls
and the growing stronghold of new Carthage
a region they call Byrsa from their purchase
as much land as a bullshide cut in strips could circle
But who are you what country are you from
370 where do you head Aeneas answered with a sigh
and drew his words from deep inside his heart
Goddess if I traced my story from the start
63

and you had time to hear the history of our pain
the Evening Star would close the day and heavens gates
We come from what was Troyperhaps its name has reached
your ears But as we traveled many seas a storm
drove us to Libyas coast by chance Im pious
Aeneas On my fleet I carry gods saved
from the enemy my fame reaches the sky
380 my blood is Joves I head for Italy our home
I launched twenty ships upon the Phrygian sea
following fate and my mother showed the way
Just seven ships survive lashed by wind and waves
And II roam the Libyan desert unknown beggared
spurned by East and West Venus was annoyed
by these complaints and she cut his laments short
I doubt the gods despise you whoever you may be
You breathe the air youre near a Tyrian town
Continue and youll reach the palace of the queen
390 I have some news your friends are safe your fleet
is here blown by shifting windsunless
my parents taught me augury in vain
See those twelve swans gladly flying in formation
Joves great eagle plunged from open skies
and scattered them Now regrouped they land
in a long line or gaze at those whove landed
Just as theyve returned flapping their wings
in play wheeling round the sky with honks
so too your ships and men have entered port
400 or now approach the harbor with full sail
Keep on and follow where the trail leads

64

As she turned away her neck gleamed rosily
her ambrosial hair gave off a divine scent
and her robes grew longer flowing to her feet
Her gait too revealed the goddess But Aeneas
when he recognized his mother called to her
Why trick your son so often with disguises
Youre as cruel as the other gods Why cant I
ever hold your hand in mine or speak frankly
410 Grumbling so he turned his steps to town

As they went Venus veiled them in dark mist
and draped them with a heavy cloak of cloud
so no one could see or stumble on them
or cause delay or ask why they were there
She herself went up to Paphos happy to
go home where her temples hundred altars
were fragrant with fresh wreaths and warm with incense
Meanwhile they hurried on along the path
They climbed a hill that steeply overhung
420 the town and looked down on the citadel
Aeneas admired its size once it had mere huts
its gates the hubbub and the cobbled streets
One group worked to raise the walls and fortify
the citadel they rolled up rocks by hand
Some shaped homesteads circling them with trenches
or chose a sacred senate laws and offices
Here men hollowed out a harbor there they laid down
bedrock for a theater and hacked tall columns
out of cliffs to ornament a future stage
430 They were like busy bees in fields of flowers
65

in the early summer when they lead out
their grown young or cram the combs with honey
and swell them with sweet nectar or unload
returning bees or join in ranks to drive
the idle throng of drones off from their hives
The work hums along the honey smells of thyme
Lucky you whose walls are rising now
cried Aeneas as he stared up at the rooftops
Fenced around by mist he walked the crowded streets
440 Amazingly he mixed with them and no one saw
The city center held a thickly shaded grove
where the Tyrians tossed by storms at sea
had first dug up the omen Juno spoke of
a stallions headmeaning theyd be a race
unmatched in war and prosperous through the ages
Here Dido of Tyre was building Juno a huge
temple rich in gifts rich in her godly presence
At the entry rose bronze stairs the doorposts too
were bronze the door creaked on bronze hinges
450 In this grove first a sight appeared that eased
Aeneas fear and let him dare to dream
of safety to have more hope in troubled times
As he scanned each detail of the giant temple
waiting for the queen and admired the citys
fortune and its craftsmens skill and work he saw
the stages of the Trojan War the battles blazoned
by their fame across the world Atreuss
sons King Priam and Achilles cruel to both
He stopped in tears Achates what place on earth
460 what land isnt steeped in what weve suffered Look
66

its Priam Here too glory has rewards
the world weeps and mortal matters move the heart
Let go your fear This fame will bring some safety
He spoke and fed his soul on empty images
sighing heavily Tears streamed down his face
He saw the men who fought by Pergamum
Here Greeks fled as Trojan youths pursued
There the Phrygians ran and plumed Achilles chased them
in his chariot He recognized in tears
470 Rhesus snowy tents Bloody Diomedes
had killed these men whose deep sleep was their downfall
and taken Rhesus highstrung horses to his camp
before they tasted Trojan grass or Xanthus stream
Here Troilus tried to get away his armor lost
poor boy no equal to Achilles in a fight
His horses dragged him on his back tangled with
the chariot he still held the reins His neck
and hair trailed on the ground his spearbutt scored the dust
Meanwhile Trojan women hair unbound headed
480 with a robe to the temple of Athena
Sad supplicants they beat their breasts but
the hostile goddess kept her eyes fixed on the ground
Achilles had dragged Hector round the walls of Troy
three times and now he hawked his corpse for gold
Aeneas groaned deep in his heart when he saw
the spoils the chariot the very body of his
friend and Priam stretching out defenseless hands
He saw himself as well mixed in with the Greeks
and the Eastern army and black Memnons spears
490 Penthesilea led the crescentshielded
67

Amazons a fighterqueen afire and ardent
in the crush A golden swordbelt crossed below
her naked breast a virgin dared to fight with men
While these wonders held Aeneas gaze
while he stared at each sight riveted
beautiful Queen Dido came into the temple
a retinue of soldiers packed around her
Like Diana leading dances on Eurotas
banks or Cynthus peaks surrounded by
500 a thousand mountain nymphs a quiver on her back
shes the tallest of the goddesses around her
and Latonas heart is pierced with silent joy
so Dido gladly went among her people
tending to the building of her future kingdom
Under the temples vaulted roof facing the doors
she sat on her high throne fenced in with spears
giving laws and statutes to the men assigning
the work fairly or setting tasks by lot
Suddenly Aeneas saw as they pushed through
510 a great mob Antheas brave Cloanthus and
Segestus with the other Trojans whom black storms
had flung apart at sea and driven to far shores
Aeneas was stunned Achates struck by joy
and fear They were keen to greet their friends
but these events unnerved them They stayed concealed
veiled in hollow mist to hear the mens news
Where were their crews moored Why were they here
since in the clamor envoys picked from all the ships
were coming to the shrine to ask for help

68

520 When theyd entered and had leave to speak

the eldest Ilioneus calmly began
Queen whom Jupiter allowed to build a city
and to curb proud tribes with laws we wretched
Trojans tossed by storms on every sea
plead with you to save our ships from hungry flames
See what state were in and spare a pious race
We dont come to plunder Libyan homes
with swords or divert stolen booty to the shore
such brutal arrogance is not in beaten hearts
530 Theres a place the Greeks have named Hesperia
an ancient land strong in war and rich in soil
The Oenotri settled it Rumor says
their children call themselves Italian from
their leaders name This was our heading when Orions
storms and sudden tides drove us onto lurking
shoals and swamped us The insolent south wind
scattered us through waves and hidden rocks
Now a few of us have drifted to your shores
What race is this What lands so barbaric that it
540 sanctions this behavior Were kept away from shore
by threats of war We cant set foot on land
If you scorn humans and their weapons at least
assume the gods know justice and injustice
We had a king Aeneas No one was more just
or pious nor more powerful in battle
If fate preserves him and he breathes the air
not yet sleeping with the cruel shades below
were not afraid Youd be proud to match
his kindness Sicily too has towns and fields
69

550 for us Our kinsman lives there famed Acestes

Let us haul ashore our windlashed vessels
saw planks out of trees and bind together oars
If we can sail for Italy with king and crew
then well gladly make for Latium there
If theres no hope and Libyan waters hold Aeneas
best of Trojans and Ilus too is gone
well return to the Sicilian straits the homes
we built and left behind and king Acestes
This was Ilioneus speech All the
560 Dardans roared assent to it as one
Dido answered briefly her eyes downcast
Trojans let go your fear and your worries
Harsh necessity and my new kingdom force me
to be careful and to post guards on the borders
Who doesnt know Aeneas race or Troy
Trojan courage and the flames of that great war
We Punics dont have minds so dull when the Sungod
yokes his team he doesnt shun our city
If you hope for broad Hesperia and Saturns
570 fields or king Acestes and the land of Eryx
Ill provide safe passage and help you with supplies
If you wish to settle here alongside me
the city that Im buildings yours Beach your ships
Both Tyrians and Trojans will be the same to me
How I wish your king Aeneas were here driven
by the same south wind Ill send out trusty scouts
along the shores and have them scour all Libya
in case hes shipwrecked near our woods and towns
70

Brave Achates and father Aeneas encouraged
580 by these words had long been keen to breach
the mist around them Achates urged Aeneas first
Goddessborn what thoughts surge in you now
You see that all is safe the fleet and crew are here
One mans absent whom we ourselves saw drowning
in the sea The rest is as your mother said
Hed hardly spoken when at once the cloud
around them parted melting into open air
There stood Aeneas gleaming in the clear light
godlike in his face and shoulders the goddess
590 Venus had graced her son with flowing hair
the glowing skin of youth and shining eyes
the way skill transforms ivory to art the way
a golden bezel sets off marble or plain silver
His appearance startled everyone At once
he spoke to Dido Im herethe one you asked about
Aeneas of Troy plucked from Libyan waters
O Queen only you have ached for Troys ordeal
and shared with us your town and homewe few
left by the Greeks worn out on land and sea
600 by every blow bereft We dont have means
to offer fitting thanks nor do the remnants
of the Trojans scattered through the world
May the godsif they honor pious men
if theres justice anywhere and conscience
reward you in kind What lucky ages
bore you What parents had a child like you
While rivers flow to seas and shadows cross
71

the mountain slopes while sky pastures the stars
your honor and your name and praise will last
610 for me whatever country calls He grasped the hands
of Ilioneus and Serestus right and left
then others brave Cloanthus and brave Gyas

Dido was left speechless at the sight of him
and all his suffering She asked What ill luck
drives you through such danger goddessborn
What force brings you to these arid coasts
Are you that Aeneas the son of kindly Venus
and Anchises born next to Simos at Troy
I do remember Teucer came to Sidon once
620 exiled from his country looking for new lands
with Belus help My father then was sacking
wealthy Cyprushed just conquered it
Since then Ive known about the fall of Troy
your name and the Pelasgian kings Teucer himself
though your enemy praised the Trojans highly
He claimed he came from ancient Trojan stock
So come young men enter my home Fortune once
harassed me with hardship like your own At last
the fates let me settle in this land Knowing
630 pain I can learn to help the pain of others
As she led Aeneas to her royal halls
she called for sacrifice in honor of the gods
Just as thoughtfully she sent the sailors
on the shore twenty bulls and one hundred
72

giant boars with bristling backs a hundred fatty
lambs and ewes The gods rejoiced at the gifts
Inside the palace was prepared with regal splendor
and the feast was set out in the center There were
cloths embroidered skillfully in purple
640 silver vessels on the tables and engraved
in gold her ancestors brave deeds a lengthy list
of countless heroes exploits since her peoples start

Paternal love did not allow Aeneas to rest
He sent Achates quickly to the ships to tell
Ascanius the news and bring him to the city
As a father all his care was for his cherished
son He also told Achates to bring presents
saved from ruined Troy a cloak stiff with golden
thread a veil edged with saffrondyed acanthus
650 Argive Helens finery taken from Mycenae
when she left for Troy and her illicit marriage
her mother Ledas gorgeous gifts Also
a scepter that once belonged to Priams
eldest daughter Ilione a necklace set
with pearls a crown ringed twice with gold and gems
Achates headed for the ships wasting no time
But Venus was reflecting on new plans and plots
how Amor could change his looks and take the place
of sweet Ascanius sparking the queen to madness
660 with his gifts folding flames into her marrow
She feared a dual house and forktongued Tyrians
73

and Junos cruelty chafed at her With night her cares
returned So she addressed her son winged Amor
My son my strength my refuge the one source
of my power who scorns the giantslaying bolts
of Jupiter I beg you as a supplicant
Youre aware of how Aeneas your halfbrother
is harassed on land and sea by jealous Junos
rage and youve often grieved over my grief
670 Now Phoenician Dido has him she delays him
with her flattery I fear how Junos welcome
will turn outshe wont be slow to seize her chance
My plan is to outwit her Ill circle Dido
with a blaze beyond the reach of any god
Shell be mine bound by deep love for Aeneas
Hear my thoughts on how to do this The prince
my greatest care now leaves for Sidons colony
at his loving fathers call with gifts
the sea and Trojan flames did not destroy
680 Ill put the boy to sleep and hide him high
on Cythera or in my holy shrine in Cyprus
so he wont know the scheme or stumble on it
Take his shape for just one night Boy for boy
craftily put on his wellknown face so that
when delighted Dido takes you on her lap
while wine flows at the royal feast while she holds you
planting her sweet kisses on you youll breathe
hidden flames and secret poison into her
Amor listened to his dear mother took off
690 his wings and gladly tried out Ilus gait
Venus poured calm sleep into Ascanius
74

and took him warm in her embrace up to
her shrines high groves where gentle marjoram
surrounded him with flowers and sweet shade
Now Amor left as told gladly taking regal
presents to the Tyrians Achates led him
He found Dido sitting in the central hall
on a golden couch with splendid rugs
And now Aeneas and the Trojan men arrived
700 They reclined on purple coverings
Slaves fetched water for their hands set out
bread in baskets and offered silky napkins
Fifty female houseslaves were in back to keep
the larder stocked and orderly and tend
the fires Two hundred other men and women
matched in age brought out the food and goblets
Tyrians came too crowding through the festive
threshold invited to recline on ornate couches
They admired Aeneas gifts and they admired
710 Ilus the gods bright face and lying words
Poor Dido above all marked for future ruin
couldnt sate her soul the sight set her on fire
The boy the presents charmed her equally
Ilus hugged Aeneas and clung to him filling
his false fathers heart with love Then he sought out
the queen Her eyes her heart were fixed on him
she stroked him on her lapunhappy Dido
not knowing the trap the great god laid Mindful
720 of his mother Amor bit by bit erased
Sychaeus trying to revive new love
in a heart so long asleep so long unused
75

At the first lull in the feast tables were cleared
great winejars set up and ringed with wreaths
The house was filled with noise voices ricocheted
around the vaulted halls Lighted lamps hung from
gold chains the tapers flames routed the night
The queen called for a bowl heavy with gems and gold
which Belus and his heirs had always used
730 She poured in unmixed wine A hush fell as she prayed
Jupiter they say you set the laws for hosts
May this day be glad for those from Troy
and for the Tyrians let our children mind it
May Bacchus who brings joy attend and good Juno
Tyrians honor and support our union
Dido poured a gift of wine upon the altar
the first to touch the goblet to her lips
then challenged Bitias No slouch he drank
the foaming cup swilling from the gold
740 Next the other princes Longhaired Ipas
great Atlas pupil plucked his gilded lyre
He sang of lunar cycles eclipses of the sun
the origins of man and beast and rain and fire
the star Arcturus the wet Hyades and twin
Bears why winter suns are quick to dip
into the Ocean what makes cold nights linger
The Tyrians doubled their applause the Trojans too
Doomed Dido too was drawing out the night
with varied talk but the cup she drained was love
750 She had many questions about Hector Priam
the armor Memnon had when he arrived
Diomedes horses and Achilles strength
Better yet tell us from the start my guest
76

the story of Greek treachery your peoples ruin
and your travels its the seventh summer now
that youve roamed through all the lands and seas

77

BOOK 2

They all fell silent fixing their eyes on Aeneas
From his seat of honor he began Queen
you ask me to relive an anguish beyond words
how the Greeks destroyed Troys kingdom and her wealth
I saw the piteous events myselfI played
no minor part Which of cruel Ulysses men
what Dolopian or Myrmidon could speak
of it dryeyed Meanwhile damp night hurries
from the sky the setting stars urge us to sleep
10 But if you long so much to learn of our ordeal
to hear in brief the tale of Troys last throes
Ill speak though I shudder to recall it and
recoil in grief
Broken by war snubbed by fate
the Greek leaders had seen many years slip by
They built a giant horse with the help of Pallas
skill interweaving ribs with planks of pine
They claimed it was an offering for their safe return
that rumor spread But they filled the horses hidden
flanks with soldiers picked by lot the massive
20 womb was packed with warriors and weapons

78

Theres an island Tenedos in sight of Troy
famed and wealthy once while Priams Troy still stood
Now its just a bay with treacherous mooring
The Greeks sail there and hide on a deserted beach
We think theyve left sailing for Mycenae
on the wind All Troy shakes off her lengthy grief
The gates are opened and we go with joy to see
the empty Doric camps the deserted shore
Here thered been Dolopians and cruel Achilles
30 tent The fleet moored there there the front lines fought
Some gape at the gift our ruin to unwed
Athena amazed at its size Thymoetes
urges us to bring it in and set it on
the citadel Perhaps this is treason perhaps
our destiny Capys and anyone with sense
says to hurl this trap this suspect gift of Greeks
into the sea or set a fire under it
or bore into its hollow womb to probe inside
The crowd is undecided we split into two camps
40 Then Laocon a huge mob in his wake

runs down in a hurry from the city heights
Still far he shouts Poor Trojans are you mad
You think the enemy has sailed away Are Greek
gifts free of guile Is that Ulysses nature
Either enemies are hidden in the wood
or else this thing was built to breach our walls
to watch our homes and city from above
Some trick lurks here Citizens dont trust the horse
I fear Greeks even bringing offerings
50 With all his force he flung a giant spear
79

at the jointed curving belly of the beast
It stuck there quivering the hollow space
inside the womb responded with a groan
And if the gods and fate had not been hostile
wed have breached the Argive lair with swords
Troy and Priams citadel would still be standing

Now a group of Dardan shepherds in an uproar
dragged a man to Priam hands bound behind his back
They didnt know hed let them stumble onto him
60 that he planned to throw Troy open to the Greeks
He was poised and ready for two outcomes
to ply his tricks or meet a certain death
Trojans rushed from everywhere crowding round
the captive keen to see and jeer the loudest
Now hear how the Greeks baited their trap and from
one act of treachery understand them all
Jostled and unarmed facing all our stares
he stood and gazed round at the Phrygian ranks
and groaned What land what sea can save me now
70 What fates in store after my suffering
I have no place among the Greeks and worse
the hostile Trojans want my blood With this lament
he changed our minds and checked our impetus
We prompted him to tell us who he was what news
he had why he might hope for pity though a captive
Finally he set aside his fear and spoke
King Ill tell you everything all the truth
come what may I wont deny Im Greek
80

Ill say this first if wicked Fortunes ruined
80 Sinon she wont make him an empty liar too
Has some news of glorious Palamedes
Belus son yet reached your ears He spoke out
against the Trojan War so the Argives killed him
on false charges though he was innocent
Now they mourn the man they robbed of light
He was our relative and when I was a boy
my pauper father sent me as his page
While power lent him safety and he prospered
in the royal council I too had some fame
90 and honor But when he left the shores of life
thanks to sly Ulysses malice you know it well
I wore out my life in grief and shadows
livid at the murder of my blameless friend
Madman that I was I didnt hold my tongue
I swore vengeance if we won the war
and I got home to Greece My words roused hate
my first slip on ruins path From then on
Ulysses terrified me with his accusations
and spread rumors to the army to get allies
100 for his plot He didnt rest till Calchas helped
but why tell a tale that no one wants to hear
Why play for time If all Greeks are the same and you
know Im Greek kill me now The Ithacan
would love it the Atridae would pay handsomely
Now we burned still more to hear what happened
blind to this great evil to Greek skill in lies
He went on shaking with contrived emotion

81

The weary Argives often wanted to break camp
to leave the endless fighting and abandon Troy
110 How I wish they had But harsh weather kept them
from the sea and the south wind scared them
every time they launched Once this horse of maple
planks was built storms thundered across the sky
Worried we dispatched Eurypylus to quiz
Apollos oracle He brought us back grim news
Greeks when you first came to Trojan shores
you pacified the breezes with a virgins blood
Only blood will get you back to Greece offer
a Greek life When the army heard this news
120 we were stunned Our blood ran chill with fear
Who had the fates selected Who did Apollo want
Then the Ithacan dragged out the prophet Calchas
and told him to reveal the gods intent Many
warned me even then about the cruel crime
Ulysses planned But though they saw it coming
they kept quiet Ten days the seer sat silent
in his tent he would not pick a man to die
At last driven by Ulysses threats he spoke
and marked me for the altaras theyd planned
130 All agreed the death each feared for himself
was bearable when shunted onto one poor wretch
The awful day arrived The rites were readied
grain was salted bands were tied around my temples
I broke free I confess it I cheated chains and death
and spent the night concealed in swampy rushes
lurking till theyd leftif by chance they would
Now Ive no hope to see my former homeland
my darling children or my longedfor father
82

whom the Greeks may punish for my flight
140 avenging my offense by killing those I love
I beg you by the gods above by the powers
that know truth by whatever trust still stands
unsullied among humans pity my ordeal
and a soul that suffers so unfairly
These tears won him life and even pity
Priam himself had the chains that bound
his hands and feet removed and spoke kind words
Whoever you may be forget the Greeks youve lost
youll be one of us Just tell me the truth
150 Why did they build this giant horse Who made it
and what for an offering or a siege
Sinon schooled in falsehood and Greek guile
raised his hands now free of chains up to the sky
and cried I call to witness the eternal flames
and sacred powers the altar and the cruel
sword I fled the holy bands I wore as victim
Its right to break my sworn oath to the Greeks
its right to hate those men and bring to light
all that they hide No homeland no laws hold me
160 Troy if I speak truth if I repay you richly
then keep your pledge save me as I save you
From the start the Argives every hope their trust
in victory depended on Athena But when
godless Diomedes and that architect
of crime Ulysses crept into her shrine to steal
Pallas fateful likeness killed the guards
seized the sacred statue and dared defile
the goddess headbands with their bloody hands
83

Greek hopes waned receded ebbed away
170 Their strength is crushed the goddess is estranged
Pallas gave signs of this with clear omens
Hardly was the statue set in camp when flames
shot blazing from its staring eyes its wood
poured sweat and incredibly Pallas herself
sprang up three times brandishing her sword
and quivering spear At once Calchas told us
that we had to leave and brave the seas our swords
would not raze Troy without new signs from Greece
We had to pacify the gods wed traveled with
180 in our curved keels So theyre sailing to Mycenae
to rearm and get good omens theyll be back
just when you dont expect them This was Calchas reading
They built the horse on his advice to atone
for the Palladium and the offended goddess
He ordered them to raise a towering mass
of woven planks that reached up to the sky
so big it couldnt pass your gates into the city
and save you now that the Palladium is gone
If your hands pollute Athenas offering
190 then utter ruin will bring down Priams empire
may the gods turn back the omen on the seer
but if you help the horse climb to the citadel
Asia will bring great war to Pelops walls
and ruin will fall on our children instead
Through this trap this skillful lying Sinons story
won us over We were captured by forced tears
and falsehoodswe whom Diomedes and Achilles
ten years a thousand ships had failed to conquer
84

Now another crisis still more terrifying
200 struck our suffering people panicked our blind hearts
Laocon chosen by lot as Neptunes priest
was slaughtering a huge bull at the altar
Suddenly twin snakes from Tenedos
I shudder at the tellingheaded for the shore
their giant coils cutting through calm waters
their chests and bloodred crests raised high over
the surface Behind their tails skimmed the sea
giant slinky corkscrews leaving a huge wake
The sea foamed and splashed then they were ashore
210 Their eyes were flaming shot with blood and fire
As they hissed they licked their jaws with flicking tongues
Our blood drained and we scattered from the sight
They made a beeline for Laocon First
they twisted round his two sons tiny bodies
feeding on their helpless flesh with fangs
Then they snared the father as he ran to help
bringing his spear They bound him with huge loops
twice circling his waist and throat with scaly
trunks their heads and necks rearing above
220 As he tried to break their knots with both his hands
his headbands slimed with venom and black gore
his awful shrieks rose to the skylike the bellows
of a wounded bull when hes escaped the altar
and dislodged the ax halfburied in his neck
Then the two snakes glided to the shrine of Tritons
daughter and her Trojan citadel and hid
under her statues feet and rounded shield
And now a new fear crept into our shaken hearts
85

We said Laocon deserved to pay this price
230 since his speartip wounded sacred wood
since he flung his profane weapon at the horse
We resolved to take it to Athenas temple
and appease the goddess with our prayers
We breached our wallsour ownand laid the city open
Then we set to work We laid down gliding wheels
under the hooves and hemp ropes round the neck
The deadly mechanism climbed our city weapons
in its womb Boys and unwed girls thronged round it
singing hymns glad to touch the cable The thing
240 slid ominously to the citadel O Troy
My land home of gods Dardan walls
famous in war Four times the horse balked at the gates
four times its womb clattered with swords
But we pressed on careless blind with passion we set
the fatal monster on our sacred citadel
Then Cassandra told our future but no Trojan
would believe herthis was Apollos will
And we poor things on our final day of life
decked the holy shrines with wreaths throughout the town
250 The heavens wheeled and night arrived from Ocean

veiling earth and skyand the Greek treachery
with farflung shadow Scattered through the city
the Trojans were silent Sleep held their weary bodies
Meanwhile the Greek fleet left Tenedos under
the moons complicit quiet heading for familiar
shores The kings ship lit a beacon and Sinon
saved by gods and cruel fate secretly freed
the soldiers from their prison in the pinewood womb
86

The unlatched horse returned them to fresh air Cruel
260 Ulysses Sthenelus Thessandrus gladly
left the hollow belly on a lowered rope
next Acamas and Thoas then Achilles son
Neoptolemus Machaon and
Menelaus then the horses builder
Epeus Marauding through a city sunk
in wine and sleep they killed the guards Opening
the gates they met their friends and joined up as planned
It was the time when sleep first comes to weary mortals
creeping over us the sweetest gift of gods
270 But in my dreams grieving Hector came to me
weeping floods of tears looking as he did
when dragged behind Achilles chariot
black with bloody dust his swollen ankles pierced
by thongs How pitiable how altered from the man
who took Achilles armor as his spoils
who lobbed Trojan flares onto Greek prows
His beard and hair were matted with dry blood
and he had the many wounds received in fighting
for his citys walls Weeping myself
280 I spoke to him in grief Light of our land
Troys most trusted hope why have you come
so late What shores sent you longedfor Hector
Were exhausted from the slaughter of our people
the great sufferings of our men our city
But who so vilely mangled your kind face
Whats the meaning of these wounds No reply
to this no time for useless questions He heaved
a groan from deep inside and said Get out
87

goddessborn save yourself from flames
290 Greeks control the city Troy falls from her heights
Enoughs been done for Priam and our country
if Pergamum could be defended Id have done it
Troy entrusts her holy rites and gods to you
Take these partners of your fate and once youve crossed
the sea build them great walls From the shrine
he fetched the holy headbands and the everliving
flame of Vesta goddess of the hearth
From the city there rose mingled screams of anguish
More and morealthough my fathers home
300 was set apart and blocked by treesthe noise
grew louder wars full horror closed on us
Shaken from my sleep I scaled the highest point
of the roof and stood straining to hear
The sound was like a fire fanned by raging wind
that devastates the wheat like rivers pouring down
a mountainslope to flatten farmlands and ripe crops
the oxens work and drag trees headlong A shepherd hears
the noise from his rocky crag and listens baffled
Then truly how the Greeks keep faith was clear to see
310 Deiphobus great palace fell devoured by fire
Ucalegons next door was bright with flame
Sigeums broad straits mirrored the inferno
The shouts of men the blare of horns rose to the sky
Crazed I grabbed my sword I had no plan and yet
I burned to band a group for war to storm
the citadel with friends Rage and fury drove me
I felt it was a lovely thing to die in battle

88

But now Panthus Othrys son the priest of Phoebus
slipped past the Greek spears to sprint in panic
320 to my door holding our defeated gods
dragging his small grandson by the hand I asked
Panthus wheres the heart of battle Wheres our stand
At my words he groaned and said The final day
has come for Troy the hour of no escape We were
Trojans this was Ilium our fame was great
Cruel Jupiter has given everything
to Argos Greeks rule in our burning city
The horse stands on the citadel disgorging soldiers
the victor Sinon revels as he feeds the flames
330 Greeks in thousands gather at the open gates
the most whove ever come from great Mycenae
Still others man the checkpoints swords unsheathed
a glinting line of blades prepared to kill
Our guards at the entrance have no room
to fight but still resist and battle blindly Panthus
words and the gods will propelled me into armor
and to the citys flames where grim Fury
and the clamor called me where shouts rose to the sky
Riphaeus and Epytus a mighty fighter
340 joined us appearing in the moonlight Dymas
and Hypanis blended with our band and young
Coroebus Mygdons son whod just arrived
in Troy on fire with passion for Cassandra
He was fighting for his inlaw Priam
and the Phrygiansunhappy man who didnt follow
his brides warnings when the god inspired her
When I saw them gathered on fire for the fight
89

I spoke to rouse them further My friends so brave
for a lost cause if youre set on joining me
350 in certain death you see the way things stand
All the gods whose strength supported Troy
have left their shrines and altars The city you defend
already burns Lets die by plunging into war
Our only refuge is to have no hope of refuge
This fired their frenzy We became like wolves
prowling in night fog mere bellies driven by
harsh hunger our pups with parched throats waiting
in their dens We went past hostile spears to meet
our end making our way to the citys heart
360 Black night swept round us dark and void
Who could describe the death and devastation
of that night what tears could match our anguish
Our ancient city fell so long a seat of power
There were bodies everywhere They lay unmoving
in the streets and houses in the temples
of the gods But we are not the only ones
to pay with blood Bravery returned to beaten
hearts as well Greek victors fell All around
were bitter grief and fear and different scenes of death
370 The first Greek to meet us with a band of men

Androgeos wrongly took us to be allies
and addressed us affably Hurry men
Whats the reason for this slowness Others
search for booty and grab spoils from burning Troy
Are you just now coming from the ships
Our answers strained his trust he saw at once
hed stumbled on the enemy He stepped back
90

stunned and falling silentas if hed just
trampled on a hidden snake in prickly brambles
380 then recoiled in fear as the adder reared
in rage puffing out its skyblue hood
Like this he fell back horrified to see us
We charged the group and fenced them in with swords
On unfamiliar ground they panickedand we
slaughtered them Fortune favored our first clash
Buoyed by this success Coroebus yelled
exultantly My friends this is Fortunes path
Lets take the way to safety that shes shown
swapping shields and helmets with the Greeks
390 Is it deceit or bravery Who cares in war
Theyll give us their armor He took Androgeoss
blazoned shield and crested helmet as his own
Then he strapped a Greek sword to his side
Dymas Rhipeus and all the men did too
delighted They armed themselves with these new spoils
We moved on mixed in with the Greeks under their gods
We fought many scuffles in the murky dark
we dispatched many Danans to Hades
Others scattered to the ships and the safety
400 of the shore Some scaled the massive horse
in shameful fear to hide inside the wellknown womb
How wrong it is to trust the gods against their will
Cassandra Priams daughter was being dragged
by her long hair from Pallas inner shrine
In vain she turned her burning eyes to heaven
her eyes since her gentle hands were bound with rope
Coroebus could not bear the sight Mad with rage
91

he plunged into the fray ready to die
We followed all of us closing ranks and rushing
410 But we were overwhelmed by friendly spears
thrown by Trojans from the temple roof
Our Greek crests and armor caused this wretched carnage
Then the Greeks groaning angrily at our
attempted rescue rallied from all sides and charged
Dolopians fierce Ajax the Atridae
like a breaking storm when all the winds collide
west with south and east driven by Dawns horses
and the forests shriek Nereus whips the seafoam
with his trident churning up the depths
420 Those wed routed by our trick and driven
through the city in the dark of night return
Theyre the first to recognize our shields
and lying armor to note our different dialect
Its over Their numbers crush us Coroebus
is first to fall Hes killed by Peneleus
at the warrior goddess altar Rhipeus
dies too Troys most just and righteous man
the gods didnt care Dymas and Hypanis
perish speared by their friends Your piety
430 does nothing Panthus nor Apollos ribbons
O Troys ashes death pyre of my people
I swear by you that as you fell I didnt run
from risk or Argive spears If my fate were death
Id have earned it like a warrior Our group
splits up I have Pelias and Iphitus
one slowed by age the other by Ulysses wound
Shouts near Priams palace summon us at once
And here the scale of war eclipses every battle
92

and the city full of death here the God
440 of War has truly gone berserk We see the Greeks
storming the palace doors their shields providing shelter
Next ladders hug the walls and men inch up the rungs
holding shields in their left hands against missiles
and grasping ramparts with their right When the Trojans
see the end on the very brink of death
they break off pieces of the roof and battlements
to use in their defense throwing down the gilded
beams so prized by our ancestors Others
draw their blades to guard the palace doors below
450 crowding round them in dense ranks Our courage
wakes again and we run to help the royal
home relieve the men and reinforce the beaten
There was a hidden rear entrance to the palace
to a passage running between Priams halls
While the kingdom lasted poor Andromache
often took this path to see her royal inlaws
unattended taking small Astyanax
to his grandfather Through this I reach the roof
where doomed Trojans hurl their spears in vain
460 At the roofs sheer edge a tower rises skyward
From this you could see all Troy the Greek ships
and their camp We strike this tower with our swords
where its joints are most stressed by the many floors
and pry it from its perch Shoved over the edge
it plunges with a crash bringing ruin with it
crushing the Greek soldiers far and wide
But others take their place the barrage
of rocks and varied missiles never ceases
93

Heres Pyrrhus flashing in bronze armor
470 exulting with his weapons at the entryway like
a snake fed by toxic plants whose bloated length
chill winter shields under the soil Come spring
he sheds his skin emerging new and shiny
coiling his sleek length upward to the sun
his threeforked tongue darts in and out
Great Periphas and Achilles armorbearer
and charioteer Automedon storm the palace
with the Scyrians and throw up torches
on the roof In front Pyrrhus makes short work
480 of heavy doors He snatches up a double ax
and tears the bronze jambs from their hinges hacks
the panels smashes solid oak A window opens
to the palace long halls and courts appear
He sees Priams sanctuary used by kings
of old and armed men guarding at the entrance
Inside moans mix with sobbing and confusion
the vaulted halls resound with womens weeping
The clamor rises to the golden stars
Terrorstricken mothers roam the spacious rooms
490 or cling to doorposts kissing them Pyrrhus
presses forward with his fathers strength No lock
no sentries slow him down The doors collapse
before his battering ram and fall off damaged hinges
Brute force has made a path and the Greeks break in
butcher the front guard and fill the place with troops
They swoop in faster than a churning stream
thats burst its banks and smashes through the dikes
a wall of water floods the fields dragging
herds and stalls across the land I saw bloodcrazed
94

500 Pyrrhus charge in with the two Atridae

By the altar I saw Hecuba her sons
one hundred wives and Priam polluting with his blood
the altarfires hed blessed The fifty marriage beds
that promised many children the doors that flaunted
foreign gold and spoilsall of it destroyed
The Greeks owned everything the fire spared
Perhaps you wonder about Priams fate
When he saw Troy fallen his palace blasted open
the enemy squarely inside the old man strapped
510 his longneglected armor to his shaking frame
a futile act and took his useless sword
He ran to die among the mass of Greeks
In the palace center beneath the open sky
there was a giant altar An ancient laurel tree
leaned over it and cast shade on the housegods
Hecuba was huddled here with her daughters
like doves driven earthward by dark storms They sat
clinging to the gods statues in worthless hope
When she noticed Priam taking up the armor
520 of his youth she cried What deadly thoughts poor husband
make you arm yourself Where are you rushing
This is no time for such help even if
my Hector were here himself Come this altar
will save us all or well die together She drew
the old man close and sat him in that sacred place
Now Priams son Polites rushes in
fleeing Pyrrhus butchery past Greek spears
through long halls and empty courtyards wounded
95

with Pyrrhus in fierce pursuit so close
530 to catching him and pushing in the spear
In his parents sight at last their son
goes down His life and blood gush out together
At this Priam himself at deaths door
cannot hold back He shouts in fury Pyrrhus
For this murder for all your outrages
I hope the gods pay you as you deserve
if theres any piety in heaven
that cares about such thingsforcing me to see
the slaughter of my son fouling a fathers eyes
540 Achilles whom you claim as father in your lies
was no such enemy to Priam He had respect
for the rights of supplicants for their trust
in him He gave me Hectors pallid corpse
for burial and let me go back to my throne
The old man threw his feeble spear The clanging bronze
of Pyrrhus shield blocked it easily it dangled
useless from the central boss Pyrrhus replied
Then be my messengergo tell my father
of the evil deeds of his degenerate son
550 Now die The old man was dragged trembling to the altar
slipping in his dead sons blood Pyrrhus grabbed
his hair and with his other hand unsheathed
his flashing sword He sank it in the kings side
to the hilt This was Priams end
the death that fate had given him to watch
Troy fall in flames Once proud ruler over Asias
countless lands and people he lies now on the shore
a giant trunk without a head a nameless corpse

96

Then a ghastly dread came over me
560 When I saw the old king gasping out his life
from that brutal wound I froze thinking of
my dear father and Creusa all alone
our household sacked small Ilus maybe
dead already I turned to see which men were left
Theyd all abandoned me exhausted and despairing
theyd fallen off the roof or stumbled into flames
I was the only one of them alive
As I roamed through Troy staring at a city
lit by fire everywhere I saw Helen
570 inside Vestas shrine lurking in a corner
She feared the Trojans hatred for her role
in our defeat but also the Greeks vengeance
and the anger of her cuckold spouse A curse
to Troy and Greece the hateful thing clung to the altar
Flames of rage rose in my heartI wanted vengeance
for my country She had to die for what she did
Why should she go safely back to Sparta
and her home Mycenae a triumphant queen
Why should she see her husband and her family
580 tended by a throng of captive Trojan boys
and girls Priam perished by the sword Troy burned
the Dardan shore so often oozed with bloodfor this
No Punishing a woman brings no glory
but this would win me praiserubbing out
this foulness with the punishment that she
deserves Ill drink my fill of flames of vengeance
and appease the ashes of my people
But as I raved and blustered in my rage
97

my gentle mother showed herself to me
590 never before so clear shining purely
in the dark showing her divinity
as she appears to other gods She took my hand
to stop me These words came from her rosy lips
My son what great sorrow spurs this reckless rage
Why so angry Wheres your love for us
Wont you go see if Anchises aged and weary
is where you left him and if your wife Creusa
and your son Ascanius are still alive
Greek ranks mill all around them If not for my care
600 flames would have them swords would spill their blood
Dont blame Paris or Helens hateful beauty
Its the cruelty of the gods thats overturned
our wealth and hurls Troy from her heights Look
Ill tear away the swirling mist that dulls
your human vision with its damp embrace
For your part dont fear to carry out
your mothers orders obey her advice
Here where you see a heap of ruins boulders
torn apart and dusty smoke that billows high
610 Neptunes prying up the walls and bedrock with his
giant trident shaking and uprooting the whole
city Here savage Junos first to seize
the Scaean Gates She furiously calls the allied
army from the ships her sword strapped at her side
There Tritonian Pallas holds the heights
Her aura and her savage Gorgonshield gleam bright
Jupiter himself infuses them with strength
and spirit himself goads on the gods against Troys army
Escape my son and give up on your efforts
98

620 Ill stay and set you safely at your fathers door

She spoke then vanished in the nights thick shadow
Awful shapes appeared and the power
of the gods that hated Troy Now I clearly
saw all Ilium collapsing in the flames
and Troy once Neptunes city toppled from her roots
like an ancient ash that mountain woodsmen
hurry to uproot They strike the wounded trunk
with axes many times As each blow shakes
the leafy crown the tree seems just about to fall
630 Bit by bit its overwhelmed It groans
and topples leaving ruin in its wake
The gods guide my descent and I slip through
hostile fire Spears and flames retreat before me
When I reached the entrance to my parents
ancient home my fatherwhom I was so keen
to carry to the mountain heights the one
I looked for first of allrefused to live
or suffer exile now that Troy was lost
You should go he said your lifeblood is still
640 fresh and you have your strength Escape
If the gods had wanted me to live theyd have
saved my home Its enoughtoo muchto have
survived the sacking of the city once already
Say goodbye and leave my body lying here
On my own Ill find a Greek to kill me hell take
my spoils out of pity Burials no matter
Ive delayed the end too long hated by
the gods useless since the king of gods and men
struck me with his thunderbolts hot breath
99

650 So he said unmoved and would not stir

All of us broke down in tears my wife our son
the slaves We begged him not to drag us down
with him or help the Fate pursuing us
He refused sticking to his plan and place
Again I rushed to arm myself choosing death
unhappily but were there other options now
Did you think Id run off father leaving you
Did a parents lips utter this sacrilege
If the gods want Troy annihilated
660 if youve resolved to add yourself and yours
to her collapse the door is open Soon Pyrrhus will
come from Priams pools of blood Pyrrhus who
butchers sons in front of fathers fathers at
the altar Kind mother you saved me from the swords
and flames for this So I could see the enemy
invade our house see my father son
and wife slaughtered in each others blood
Fetch my armor men The last light calls the conquered
Lead me to the Greeks Ill fight this war again
670 Not all of us will die today without revenge
Again I fastened on my sword lifted my shield
by its strap and went to leave But at the door
my wife crumpled to my feet and held up little
Ilus If youre going to your death she said
take us to die with you But if the past has shown
that you can trust your weapons guard this house first
Youre deserting your small son your father
and your future widowjust think to whom

100

She was filling all the house with her lament
680 when suddenly amazingly there came an omen
As we held our son in both our arms and grieved
a soft light seemed to pour out from the top
of Ilus head and a harmless fire
licked his tender curls and flickered round his face
Shaking and afraid we rushed to knock the flames
out of his hair and douse the sacred fire with water
But my father looked up at the stars with joy
stretching out his hands to heaven He prayed
Almighty Jupiter if any prayers move you
690 look at us thats all and if our piety
is worthy help us and confirm your omen
At the old mans words a sudden thunder
rumbled on our left and a shooting star
fell from the sky and flew across the dark
trailing flame and blinding light We watched it
glide over the rooftops and then bury
its bright path in Idas forests Just a glowing
wake remained Sulfur smoked from all the land
Now my father was defeated He rose prayed to
700 the gods and hailed the sacred star No more delay
Gods of Troy I follow you Ill go where
you lead us Save my household and my grandson
This sign is yours Troy is in your power
I give in my son I wont refuse to leave
Already the inferno grew louder through the city
We could feel the rolling waves of heat
Come then dear father hold my neck I said
Ill take you on my back you wont weigh me
101

down Come what may well share one danger
710 or one escape Let small Ilus stay with me
My wife will trail our passage at a distance
Houseslaves pay attention As you leave the city
theres an ancient shrine of Ceres on a hill
its abandoned Near it grows an ancient cypress
tended by our fathers reverence for many
years Take different pathswell meet right there
Father take the holy vessels and our gods
Ive come from lengthy battle and fresh slaughter
I cant touch them till I clean myself in flowing
720 water I issued these commands threw a tawny
lion pelt over my brawny shoulders then bent
to lift my burden Small Ilus held
my hand keeping up with childish steps
My wife followed us we stayed in the shadows
And though I was so recently indifferent
to spears and crowds of hostile Greeks I was anxious
now set on edge by every breeze and sound
fearful for my burden and companion
Just as we approached the city gates
730 and I thought wed made it safely to the end
suddenly the sound of swiftly marching feet
seemed to come our way and my father peering
through the dark shouted Run my boy theyre close
I can see their flashing shields and gleaming bronze
Here some spiteful power robbed me of my wits
I panicked and as I bolted off the path
running from the route I knew my wife
Creusa was sadly ripped from me by fate
Did she stop Get lost Sink down in exhaustion
102

740 I dont know I never saw my wife again

I hadnt turned to find her gone or thought
of her until I reached the knoll with Ceres shrine
Here when we gathered finally one soul
was missing gone from husband friends and son
I lost my mind accusing every man and god
Was there a crueler blow to me in fallen Troy
I left my son Anchises and the Trojan gods
with the others concealed in a valleys bend
Then I strapped my sword on turned back to
750 the city I was set on risking everything
retracing all of Troy exposed to death again
First I went back to the walls and the dark gate
through which Id left I looked for my former
footsteps and traced them backward through the night
Horror filled me everywhere the very silence
scared me Next I went home just in case
shed backtracked to the house The Greeks had taken it
Wind fanned the hungry fire to the roof flames rose
over everything and heatwaves warped the air
760 I left Then I returned to Priams palace and
our citadel There in the vestibule
of Junos empty shrine cruel Ulysses guarded
spoils with Phoenix All around was Trojan treasure
torn from plundered temples altars of the gods
golden bowls giant heaps of looted garments
Rounded up trembling mothers with their children
stood all around in lengthy lines I even
dared to shout into the night filling
the streets with my unhappy cries calling
103

770 Creusa many times It was in vain

But as I ran through all the citys homes
searching endlessly sad Creusas ghost
appeared to me larger than I knew her
I was aghast My hair stood up my voice
stuck in my throat She reassured me saying
Dear husband dont give in to this mad grief
None of this takes place without the gods consent
Its not right for you to take Creusa with you
as your wife Olympus ruler wont allow it
780 Your fates a long exile Youll plow the endless ocean
and make it to Hesperia where the Lydian
Tiber gently flows through fertile fields There
good fortune and a kingdom with a royal bride
are yours Dont cry for your beloved Creusa
I wont see the haughty homes of Myrmidons
or Dolopians slave to a Greek woman
Im a Trojan Venus daughterinlaw
The great mother of the gods keeps me here
on these shoresAnd now goodbyeLove our son
790 She dissolved into thin air leaving me
in tears wanting to say so much Three times
I tried to throw my arms around her neck
three times the ghost I tried to hold flowed through
my handslike a light breeze or a fleeting dream
At last the night was over and I joined my group
Here I was surprised to find a giant crowd
of new companions whod poured in women men
and soldiers a grieving throng escaping Troy
They came from all around with what they had
104

800 prepared to cross the sea to any land I chose

By now the morning star was rising over
Idas heights bringing in the day The Greeks
maintained their blockade at the gates No hope of help
I gave up lifted Father and struck out for the hills

105

BOOK 3

After the gods saw fit to shatter Asias power
and Priams guiltless peopleproud Ilium in ruins
Neptunes Troy still smoking from the ground
omens drove us to seek exile far away
in empty lands By Phrygian Idas foothills near
Antandros we toiled to build a fleet unsure where
the Fates would take us where wed settle Others joined us
Summer had just started when we spread our sails
to Fortune at my fathers order Tearfully
10 I left the shores and harbors of my land the fields
of former Troy sailing for deep seas an exile
with my people son and gods of sky and hearth
Far off lies a land Mars loves with wide plains
tilled by Thracians Fierce Lycurgus ruled there
long ago his gods and he were once Troys allies
when our luck still stood I sailed there setting
our first town along the curving shore It was
called Aeneadae for me But the fates
were hostile I was making offerings to my mother
20 and the gods who help new ventures On the shore
106

I sacrificed a glossy bull for Jupiter
There was a mound nearby with cornel shrubs
on top and bristly myrtles with sharp spikes
I went to tear green branches from the soil
so I could spread fresh sprigs upon the altar
But then I saw an awful omen beggaring
belief When I pulled the first plant from the ground
breaking off its roots beads of black blood
stained the soil with gore An icy fear
30 set me shakingmy terror froze my blood
I tried again I pulled a grudging shoot
from a new plant trying to solve the mystery
This shrub oozed dark blood too My thoughts confused
I prayed to the woodland nymphs and father Mars
guardian of the Thracian fields to make
the vision harmless and remove the omen
But when I grabbed a third clump pulling
harder bracing my knees on the sand I heard
can I speak of this tearful groans come from
40 beneath the mound A cry rose up Aeneas
must I bear your mangling too Spare my corpse
and dont pollute your pious hands Im no stranger
but a Trojan and this blood is not from wood
Oh escape this cruel and grasping shore
Im Polydorus Here a crop of iron spears
covered my torn flesh and grew into sharp branches
I stopped then overcome by fear and doubt
My hair stood on end I couldnt make a sound
Poor Priam sent this Polydorus his own son
50 to the king of Thrace to raise in secret sending
107

much gold too Hed lost trust in Trojan weapons
when he saw the siege around the city But
the king once Troys power was broken and her fortunes
in decline joined in Agamemnons triumph
He broke every sacred law slaughtered the boy
and seized the loot Unholy lust for gold Is there
nothing men wont do for you

When my terror
left me I described the omens to our leaders
above all my father and asked for their opinion
60 All felt we should leave that evil land
where guestrights were defiled and sail with the south wind
We gave Polydorus a fresh funeral
heaping up a mound of earth and built him a high
altar somber with dark ribbons and black cypress
The women circled it their hair loose in our custom
We fetched saucers foaming with warm milk
and bowls of sacrificial blood to lay his shade
to rest For one last time we called his name
As soon as we could trust the tide when the wind
70 had calmed and soft sighs called us to the sea
we hauled the ships to shore filling the beach
and sailed from port Towns and lands receded
Theres a sacred island in the deep dear to
the Nereds mother and Aegean Neptune
It roamed untethered till the pious Archer
fastened it to Myconos and high Gyaros
108

A stable home for humans now it scorns the winds
We sailed here its peaceful harbor safely welcomed
my spent crew and we revered Apollos town
80 King Anius met usking of men and Phoebus
priest crowned with holy laurel leaves
and sacred ribbons He knew his longtime friend Anchises
We clasped hands in friendship and entered his home
I was praying in a shrine of ancient stone
Apollo give my weary people walls a home
a lineage and lasting city Save this second
Troy the remnants left by cruel Achilles and
the Greeks Who will lead us Where to settle
Inspire us Father and provide us with a sign
90 At once the surroundings seemed to shake
the doors the divine laurels the whole hill
The tripod boomed the inner sanctum opened
As we sank to earth a voice came to our ears
Sturdy sons of Dardanus The land that first
produced your ancestors will gladly welcome you
when you return to her rich soil Find your
ancient mother There Aeneas line the sons
born from his sons will come to rule all lands
At Apollos words there was a roar of joy but
100 confusion too We wondered what this place was
where Phoebus told the strayers to return
My father thinking through the tales of old
said Listen leaders heres what we can hope for
Crete the birthplace of great Jove is home to
a Mount Ida the cradle of our race Men live
in its hundred spacious cities and rich kingdoms
109

From here if the storys right great father Teucer
left for Trojan shores and picked a place
to rule Our city with her citadel had not
110 yet risen and we lived in lowland valleys
Cretes home to the Great Motherand
the Corybantes bronze cymbals Idas grove
the silent rites the harnessed lions that pull
her chariot Lets take the path the gods commend
Well placate the winds and sail for Crete
Its not a lengthy trip with Jupiters goodwill
three days will see our fleet on Cretan shores
Anchises made due sacrifices at the altar
a bull to Neptune one to fair Apollo a black
120 lamb to Storm a white lamb to helpful Zephyr
Rumor had it that Idomeneus prince
of Crete was exiled from his kingdom Its coast was clear
an island free of enemies with empty homes
We left Delos port and swept the sea skirting
Naxos hilltop Bacchants green Donusa
Olearos snowwhite Paros the scattered
Cyclades islands parted by rough straits
The sailors roared and gave it all they had We urged
them on Lets get to Crete Our ancestors
130 A fair wind rose up at the stern behind us
At last we beached on the Curetes ancient shores
I eagerly built walls around our longedfor
Pergamum a name that pleased my people
I urged them Love your homes build us a citadel
And then when our boats were drawn up on dry sand
110

when the men were busy with new brides and farms
and I with giving laws and homes suddenly
from some foul tract of sky a plague arrived
to rot our flesh our trees our crops a time of dying
140 Men left sweet life behind or staggered down
deaths path The Dog Star burned the barren fields
and parched the grass the sick plants bore no fruit
Father wanted us to cross the sea again
to beg Apollos favor at his oracle
and ask Would the tired Trojans ever reach
their goal Where could we find help for hardship
It was night Sleep held the birds and beasts of earth
The sacred statues of the Phrygian gods
that Id rescued from the flames of Troy
150 stood before my eyes as I lay sleeping
revealed in the shining light the full moon cast
as it flooded through the windows They spoke
and eased my worry Of his own accord
Apollo sends us to your home to tell you here
the things hed prophesy for you at Delos
When Troy was burned we took you as our leader
we crossed the swollen ocean in your fleet
Well raise your children to the stars and give
an empire to your city You must build great walls
160 for a great race and bear your long ordeal
Your town cannot stay here Apollo didnt
want these coasts to be your home not Crete
Theres a place the Greeks call it Hesperia
an ancient land strong in war and rich of soil
The Oenetri settled it We hear their heirs
111

now call it Italy after their leaders name
Heres our proper home where Dardanus
and Isius were born the founders of our people
Rise and gladly tell your father news that cant
170 confuse him Let him look for Corythus
and Italy Jove forbids the Cretan fields
I was dumbstruck by the sight and sound of gods
It was no dream I saw them openlytheir hair
with holy bands their faces right before me
and I dripped with icy sweat Leaping from
my bed I raised my pleading hands to heaven
praying Then I offered unmixed wine upon
the hearth After this ritual I gladly told
Anchises what had happened all in order
180 He saw we had two parents and a double line
Hed made a fresh mistake about our ancient home
My son so troubled by Troys fate he said
Cassandra was the only one who saw this
I remember now she said this was the fate
foretold for us and often spoke of our Italian
kingdom in the west But whod believe in Trojans
coming to Hesperia And whom could she
convince back then Lets yield to Apollo and
the better path We all obeyed him happily
190 leaving this home tooonly a few stayed
We spread our sails and skimmed across the endless sea
Once our boats reached open water with no land
in sight just sky and ocean all around
a black cloud lodged over us bringing night
and storm the ocean bristled with dark shadows
112

Wind whipped the water into looming waves
We were tossed and scattered in the vast abyss
Clouds rolled in to hide the sky Damp night
stole our daylight lightning split the clouds
200 Thrown off course we wandered the waves blindly
Even Palinurus couldnt tell the dark
from day or get our bearing in midsea
For three uncertain days three starless nights
we wandered in dark fog over the water
On the fourth at last we saw a land rise up
We made out distant hills and curling smoke
We furled the sails and strained against our oars
churning up foam at once sweeping across the waves
The Strophades islands took me inI was
210 safely on dry land Their name is Greek theyre in
the great Ionian sea Vile Celaeno
and her Harpies had been living there
since Phineus home was closed to them
and they fled their former feasts Nothing fouler
nothing worse has ever risen from the Styx
to show the anger of the gods Theyre birds
with young girls faces but their bellydroppings stink
their hands are hooked their faces always pale
with hunger When we sailed into this port we saw
220 lush herds of cattle in the fields a flock of goats
grazing the grass and no shepherds anywhere
We fell on them with swords and called the gods
and Jupiter to share our spoils Then we made some
seats along the curving coast and ate rich meat
Suddenly the Harpies were there from the hills
a ghastly swoop of beating clattering wings
113

They tore our food and fouled it all with filth
Besides their horrid shrieks the stench was awful
We tried again At the far back of a cave
230 screened by trees and skittering shadows all around
we prepared our meal and lit the altars
once again And again from some new place
or secret lair the screeching throng flew round our food
sliming it with crooked claws and filthy beaks
I told my men to grab their swords to war
with this vile flock They obeyed and hid their shields
and weapons in the grass This time when
the Harpies swooped down screaming to the curving
shore Misenus blared his horn to signal
240 from his lookout My men charged in for the strange fight
They gashed the stinking seabirds with their swords
But the Harpies plumes and backs received no wounds
They glided off in rapid flight and left behind
their halfeaten booty and their reeking waste
By herself Celaeno perched upon a rock
a prophetess of grief This shriek burst from her chest
So its war you want sons of Laomedon
As thanks for our butchered cows and bulls
you drive the faultless Harpies from their homeland
250 Then hear my words and fix them deep inside your heart
The mighty Father told Apollo this and he
told me and I the greatest Fury now tell you
You sail for Italy summoning the winds
youll reach her and her ports will open to you
But you wont set walls around your fated city
until wrenching hunger and your harm to us
114

will have your jaws gnawing your very tables
She spoke and winged her path back to the woods
But my mens blood froze with sudden fear
260 courage gone they called on me to plead for peace
not with swords but vows and prayers no matter
if the things were goddesses or grotesque birds
On the shore Anchises called on the great gods
his palms stretched out promising them sacrifice
Gods ward off these threats and this disaster
Be kind and protect the pious He ordered us
to rip the mooring from the shore and free the rigging
South winds filled the sails we fled through foamy waves
along the path our helmsman and the winds dictated
270 Zacynthus woods appeared in midsea
then Dulichium Sam and the sheer cliffs
of Neritos We rushed past rocky Ithaca
Laertes land and cursed the soil that nurtured cruel
Ulysses Soon the cloudy peaks of Mount Leucata
could be seen and Apollos headland feared
by sailors Weary we approached the little town
anchored and moored our ships along the shore
Against all hope wed finally reached land
We cleansed ourselves for Jupiter burned altar
280 offerings and filled the shores of Actium
for Trojan games My naked comrades wrestled
slick with oil as in Troy glad to have
evaded countless cities of the enemy
The sun circled a full year and icy winter
scuffed the waves with northern winds I fixed a shield
of curving bronze that great Abas once carried
115

to the temple doorpost with this dedication
Aeneas gives these spoils from the Greek victors
Then I had the sailors take their seats and leave
290 the port Eagerly they swept the sea with oars
Soon Phaeacias peaks vanished behind us
We skirted Epirus and reached Chaonias
harbor then climbed on foot to steep Buthrotum
Here we heard astounding news Helenus son
of Priam ruled over Greek cities Hed won Pyrrhus
wife and scepterthat Pyrrhus Achilles son
Andromache was once more married to a Trojan
I was stunned and burned with great desire
to speak to him and understand what happened
300 I set out from port leaving ships and shore
and saw Andromache outside the city
in the woods beside a second Simos
giving Hectors ashes their sad yearly gift
calling on his spirit by his empty graves
green sod Shed raised two altars in his honor
a place for tears When she saw me with my Trojan
troops she panicked at this ghostly sight and froze
Then warmth fled her body and she fainted
When she finally revived she asked
310 Is this really your face do you really bring news
goddessborn Are you alive Or if lifes light
has left you where is Hector As she wept
her laments filled land and sky In this frenzy
I could barely get in a few words Distressed
I stammered awkwardly I do livea life
of constant danger Dont doubt what you see
But what has happened since you lost the best
116

of husbands Have you met with better fortune
Hectors Andromache Or are you Pyrrhus
320 concubine Her face cast down she whispered
Polyxena was the luckiest forced to die
by Troys high ramparts at Achilles grave
She wasnt given to some man a lottery prize
She never warmed the victors bed in slavery
When Troy was burned they took me overseas
I bore the scornful sneers of Achilles son
and gave birth as a slave Then he married Ledas
child Spartan Hermione and gave me
to Helenus one slave to another But
330 Orestes enflamed with passion for his stolen bride
driven mad by Furies for his matricide
killed Pyrrhus when he caught him at Achilles altar
At his death part of Pyrrhus kingdom
went to Helenus who named the fields
and all Chaonia for Trojan Chaon then built
a Pergamum this fortress on the heights
But what winds or fates gave you your course
Which god let you stumble on our shore
What of the boy Ascanius Does he live
340 and breathe the air The son that your Trojan wife
Does he love the mother that he lost
Do his father and his uncle Hector rouse
the bravery and manhood he inherited
She poured this out in sobs stirring up grief
in vain when Priams son the hero Helenus
arrived from the city walls with many men
He knew his fellow Trojans and he gladly led us
117

to his home shedding floods of tears
as he spoke I saw a little Troy a tower
350 like the great one and a parched stream they called Xanthus
I embraced a Scaean Gate and my Trojans
shared my pleasure in this kindred city
The king received us in his spacious hall
In the central court we poured libations
The food was served on gold bowls were raised for toasts
And now one day then another passed Breezes
called the sails they billowed with the south winds swell
I approached Helenus and asked
Son of Troy and spokesman of the gods you know
360 Apollos will his tripods and his laurels
the stars the speech of birds the omens of
their flight All the holy signs favor
our voyage all the gods urge me to sail
to Italy and try for distant lands
But the Harpy Celaeno has prophesied
strange horrors warning us of dreadful anger
and vile famine Tell me the first dangers to
avoid and how to triumph over future hardship
Helenus offered heifers in due order
370 and asked the gods for peace He untied the bands
around his holy head and took me by the hand
up to your shrine Apollo Awe pervaded me
as the seer chanted words from the gods mouth
Goddessborn its clear you sail the seas
with divine favor The king of gods assigns
mens fates he turns the tides of fortune and
118

the world I can tell you some small part of this
so youll safely cross calm seas and dock
in an Italian port Fate forbids my knowing
380 everything and Juno stops my telling it
First Italy In your ignorance you plan
to sail into her ports thinking shes nearby
But theres no direct heading no way around
long coasts Before you build your city on safe
land you must pull your oars in the Sicilian
sea Then Italys salt waters Avernus lake
and Aeaea Circes island must be crossed
So store these signs deep in your memory
When a huge sow meets your worried eyes
390 by a lonely stream with oaklined banks
lying on the ground with thirty in her litter
the piglets at her teats all white herself white too
that place will be your city and an end to hardship
Dont fear youll eat your tables in the future
Follow fate Apollo will come when you call
But the lands and coasts of Italy that neighbor
us and that our own seas wash avoid them
All the towns are held by evil Greeks
The Locri of Naryca built their walls
400 close by Idomeneus army holds Salentos
plains Meliboean Philoctetes rules
little Petelia safe in her walls
When your ships have reached the other coast
once theyre moored and youve put altars on the shore
to pay your vows veil your head under
your purple cloak to see a hostile visage
as the sacred fire burns will ruin the omens
119

Observe this custom in your rites you and your men
Let your sons of sons keep it with purity
410 But when the breezes blow your boats along
Sicilian shores and Pelorus straits grow wide
take a lengthy detour tack left by land and sea
Avoid the coast to starboard They say these lands
were once a single mass Later convulsed
by violence they leapt apart The lengthy course
of time can cause such massive change The sea
flooded in and severed Italy
from Sicily It rushed between the fields and cities
parted by new shores and narrow foaming straits
420 Scylla guards the right side ruthless Charybdis
the left Three times a day it gulps a mass of water
to the lowest spiral in its depths
then spurts it to the sky lashing stars with spray
Scyllas lair is a dark cave From here
her mouths emerge to drag ships onto rocks
What you see at first is human to the waist
a girl with lovely breasts Below this theres
a seamonster with wolves around its belly
finally a fishtail Bend around Pachynus
430 headland though a long and circling journey rather
than confront vile Scylla in her stinking cave
and the crags that echo barks of seablue dogs
Also if Im a seer of any wisdom
if Apollo fills my mind with truth
Ill tell you one more thing thats worth it all
goddessborn and Ill repeat it many times
Worship mighty Junos power first and foremost
120

with your prayers offer vows and pleasing gifts
to win her favor This way youll leave Sicily
440 at last and sail in triumph to Italy
Once youve reached the town of Cumae near
Avernus whispering woods and sacred lakes
youll see Sibyl raving deep inside her cavern
There she sings the fates and stores her words
on leaves She puts in order what she wrote
and locks it in the cave where the leaves stay still
and keep their place But when the door swings open
and a gentle breeze disturbs them buffeting
the weightless fronds she never thinks to catch them
450 as they fly around the cave nor to put them
back in place fitting verse to verse So men
depart no wiser and they hate the Sibyls home
Dont fear that this delay will be too costly even
if your men complain and the voyage calls
the canvas to the deep as fair winds fill the sails
Meet the Sibyl plead with her to chant
her oracles herself and to set free her voice
Shell describe the tribes of Italy the wars
to come how to bear or bypass each ordeal
460 If you honor her shell bless you with fine sailing
So much I can say in my own voice Now go
and raise great Troy to heaven by your acts

When the seer had spoken these kind words
he sent gifts of gold and chiseled ivory
to the ships He filled the hulls with silver
121

copper basins from Dodona a triplelayered breastplate of gold chain mail
and a striking coneshaped helmet with
a horsehair crestNeoptolemuss armor
470 My father got gifts too along with horses
guides and rowers and weapons for my men
Meanwhile Anchises had us rig the sails
not a minute of delay if fair winds blew
Apollos prophet hailed him with great honor
Anchises fit to share proud Venus bed
loved by gods twice saved from Trojan ruins
heres Italy seize her at full sail
But avoid her coastline on this side
the part Apollo offers you is further
480 Its your luck to have a pious son
Now go I waste the surging winds by speaking
Andromache was also sad at this last parting
She brought out garments sewn with gold embroidery
and a Trojan cloak for Ilus just as lovely
Heaping him with gifts of cloth she said Take these
too my boy theyre testimony to my craft
and the lasting love of Hectors wife
Andromache Accept these last gifts of your people
you my sole surviving image of Astyanax
490 His eyes his hands and mouth were just the same
and now hed be a young man of your age
I wept as I spoke my parting words
Live well you whose fate has been fulfilled
while we are called from destiny to destiny
Youve won your relief Theres no sea to plow
122

no fields of Italy to seek as they recede
I pray that you have better fortune in your
second Xanthus and the Troy built by your hands
May the Greeks never encounter them
500 If I ever reach the Tiber and its fields
and see the ramparts granted to my race
one day well make a single Troy in spirit
from our sister cities joining Italy
to Epirus We share our founder Dardanus
and our sad past This can be our childrens task
Back at sea we skimmed Ceraunias cliffs
the shortest path to Italy by ship The sun
was setting and the hills darkened with shadow
That night we sprawled along the shore cradled by
510 the longedfor land and drew lots for the next days oars
Scattered on the beach we ate and bathed
sleep soothed our tired limbs Nights chariot
driven by the Hours was not yet near her apex
when zealous Palinurus rose to check the winds
and listen to the breezes noting every star
that crossed the silent night the rainy Hyades
Arcturus the Twin Bears Orion armed in gold
Seeing all was well across the clear sky
he blared his bugle from the stern We broke up camp
520 took to sea and spread our sails wide wings
Blushing Dawn had set the stars to flight
when far away we saw some hazy hills
Italys low profile Italy Achates
cried out first Italy the crew shouted
123

in joy Anchises filled a giant bowl with wine
and crowned it with a garland He took a stand
on the high stern and called upon the gods
O gods who rule the land and sea and storms
grant us an easy passage send fair breezes
530 The winds picked up and soon we saw a harbor
with a temple of Minerva on the heights
We trimmed the sails and turned the prows to land
Eastern tides had carved the bay into an arc
it projected rocky walls that foamed with salty
spray The temple set back from the shore was not
in sight but two cliffs sent out bluffs like open arms
Here I saw four horses our first omen
Snowy white they grazed across the fields
Anchises cried New land you bring us war
540 Horses wear wars gear this herd threatens war
Yet horses can be trained to pull a chariot
and wear a harness Theres a hope of peace
Now we invoked Pallas sacred power
goddess of the battleclash the first to greet us
in our joy Then we veiled our heads with Trojan
robes and burned due gifts at Argive Junos altar
the honor Helenus had ordered us to pay
Our prayers duly said at once we turned
the yardarms and their sails to the wind
550 and left these risky lands settled by Greeks
We saw the gulf of Tarentum Hercules city
if the storys true Then Junos shrine loomed up
and Caulons fort and Scylaceum wrecker
of ships From far we saw Sicilian Etna
124

We heard the ocean roaring loudly and waves
breaking on rocks and crashing on the shore
The shallows boiled around us the tide swirled with sand
My father shouted This must be Charybdis
Helenus told us of those cliffs and jagged rocks
560 Save yourselves my friends pull hard on the oars
They did as told and quickly Palinurus
was the first to twist his groaning prow to sea
the fleet tacked leftward using oars and wind
A curved wave thrust us to the sky then sank
As it fell we plunged down to the depths of Hades
Three times the cliffs and rocky caves boomed out
three times the spray erupted splattering the stars
Now both wind and day abandoned us Lost
worn out we drifted to the Cyclopes shore
570 The harbor there is vast and still sheltered

from the wind but Etna roars with terrible
eruptions nearby At times she spews black fog
that smokes with tar and redhot ash and hurls up
fiery spheres that lick the stars at times
she belches boulders the mountains mangled entrails
or throws great hissing globs of molten lava
up to the sky Her plunging crater seethes and bubbles
The storys that Enceladuss body scorched by
lightning stretches crushed under this mass Over
580 him huge Etna exhales fire from the fissures
in her cauldron When he shifts his weary side
all Sicily spasms and creaks smoke blocks out
the sky That night hidden in the woods
we rode out monstrous terrors We couldnt see
125

what made the soundsthere were no stars
nothing luminous just clouds in pitchblack sky
The witching hour engulfed the moon in fog
Day broke and the suns first rays appeared
Dawn dispelled damp shadows from the sky
590 Suddenly a stranger staggered from the forest
He was ragged and emaciated barely
human He approached us on the shore
extending pleading arms We stared at the reeking
man the matted beard the clothes fastened by thorns
And yet he was a Greek once sent to Troy to fight us
When he saw our Trojan clothes and armor
from afar he froze in terror for a moment
then rushed madly for the beach sobbing
and imploring us I beg you by the gods
600 and stars by the bright air that we breathe
take me with you Trojans Anywhere is fine
Ill be content I know I sailed in the Greek fleet
I confess I fought against Troys gods
If this was such an awful crime scatter my body
in the waves drown me in the endless sea
If I die at least I die by human hands
He grabbed my knees and clung there cringing at my feet
We urged the man to tell us who he was
his lineage the story of his suffering
610 Anchises himself didnt wait but gave the man
his hand cheering him with this clear pledge
Finally he set aside his fear and spoke
Im Ithacan unfortunate Ulysses friend
Achaemenides the pauper Adamastus
126

son I wish Id stayed poorbut Troy called to me
The crew forgot me here in a Cyclops dismal
cave when they fled this grisly place
Inside its dark and vast all gore and bloody
meat The man himselfs a gianthis head bumps
620 the stars Gods keep this monster from our lands
Hes too ugly to be seen not great at talk
He lives off his victims entrails and black blood
With these eyes I saw him grab two of our men
as he lounged inside his cave He broke
their bodies on the rocks the entrance swam
with sprays of blood I saw him chew the corpses
as they oozed black gorethe stillwarm bodies twitched
But he paid Ulysses wouldnt stand for it
He kept a cool head even in this crisis
630 When the Cyclops stuffed with food and sunk in wine
laid down his lolling head and sprawled his bulk
across the cave to sleep belching gobs of gore
and bloody wine we prayed to the great gods
then drew lots surrounded him as one
and pierced his giant eye with a sharpened stake
that eye which lurked alone under his scowling brow
like a Greek shield or Apollos sun We were
happy to avenge our comrades ghosts at last
But you must get away from here poor fools Run
640 rip your mooring from the shore A hundred other
grim Cyclopes just like Polyphemus
they pen their woolly sheep inside their caves
and milk their udders theyre just his size and shape
live above this curving shore in the high hills
Three times the full moons risen while Ive dragged
127

my life out in the forests and the hidden lairs
of beasts I watch them from a cliff and shudder
at their voices and their stomping feet
I get a meager living from the treesberries
650 and hard nutsor I rip out grass to eat
I scan my surroundings yours is the first fleet
Ive seen approach these shores Do what you want with me
Im yours if I can just escape this evil tribe
You cut short my life instead I dont care how
Right then we saw the shepherd Polyphemus
himself on a hilltop moving his vast bulk
among his flock and heading for the shores he knew
a gross misshapen massive monster with no eye
He used a pine trunk as a staff to guide his steps
660 With him were his woolly sheep his only joy
the only consolation for his fate He plunged
into the deeper water past the waves and washed
the blood that dribbled from his empty socket
grinding his teeth groaning Then he walked out
deeper Still the water didnt reach his hips
We were anxious to escape at once and take
our worthy supplicant Quietly we cut
the ropes and bent to oars churning up the water
The Cyclops heard and turned toward the sound
670 But he had no way to capture us no strength
to match the pull of the Ionian sea
He roared so loudly that the oceans waves all
trembled Italy was frightened far inland
and Etnas curving caves boomed in response
The Cyclopes heard him They rushed to the harbor
128

from the high hilltops and woods and packed the shore
We saw the brotherhood of Etna stand there
helplessly each with one grim eye an awful
gathering Their heads struck clouds like oaks whose crowns
680 reach to the sky or coneclad cypresses
in Jupiters deep forests and Dianas grove
Sharp fear drove us headlong We set the ropes
for any tack that filled the sails with favoring wind
Helenus had advised me not to steer through
Scylla and Charybdis where the slightest slip
on either side meant death We wanted to reverse
but just then a north wind rose from narrow Cape
Pelorus We passed Pantagias rocky delta the bay
of Megara lowlying Thapsus These were the shores
690 that Achaemenides luckless Ulysses friend
showed to us as we retraced his trip
An island once known as Ortygia spans the bay
of Syracuse facing wavewashed Plemyrium
They say the stream Alpheus started here and flowed
below the sea unseen Now it mixes
with Sicilian waves at Arethusas delta
We worshipped the local deities as ordered
then passed the fertile soil of Helorus marsh
Next we scraped by Pachynus high cliffs
700 and jutting rocks Camerinas there Fate
wouldnt let her move away and the fields
and town of Gela named after its rushing river
Steep Acragas displayed massive walls from far
a place that raises stallions of great spirit
As the winds picked up I passed Selinus palms
129

we skirted Lilybaeums shoals and hidden reefs
Drepanums port and shore of sorrow took us in
Here after so many storms at sea I lost
my father Anchisesmy help in every care
710 and crisis Best of parents rescued in vain from great
jeopardy you abandoned your tired son
Helenus though he warned of many horrors did not
predict this grief for me nor did grim Celaeno
This was my last hardship the end of my long travels
When I left the god sent me to your shore
Such was the godsent fate Aeneas told
his spellbound audience such his voyage
Ending it at last like this he fell silent

BOOK 4


But loves pain had already pierced the queen
She fed it with her lifeblood the hidden flame
consumed her Aeneas courage and his noble
birth haunted her thoughts His face and words
lodged in her heart Love let her find no rest in sleep
As Dawn lit up the land with Phoebus torch
and drove damp shadows from the sky Dido
turned in anguish to her second self her sister
Anna she said such nightmares torment me
10 Who is this stranger sheltered in our home
How proud and brave he is and what a warrior
I think and with good cause that hes the child of gods
fear shows up lesser men How cruelly fate
has treated him What wars he fought and sang of
If I hadnt sworn firmly and forever
not to give myself to anyone in marriage
when my first love died and stole our future
if weddings didnt sicken me perhaps Id yield
to this one fault Anna since the death of poor
20 Sychaeus when my brother drenched our altar
with his blood this man alone has moved
my heart and made me waver I recognize
131

the traces of that flame I felt before
But Id sooner have the depths of earth gape open
and almighty Father hurl me down to Hades
with his bolt to the pallid shades and inky
night before I disobey my conscience
or its laws The man who first married me
still has my love Let him guard it in his grave
30 As she spoke she soaked her chest with tears
Anna answered Sister dearer than life itself
will you waste away in grief and loneliness
and never know sweet children Venuss rewards
Do you suppose his ghost cares or his ashes
Its true no suitors moved you in your grief
not in Libya nor in Tyre You scorned Irbas
and the other chieftains whom rich Africa
has fed on triumphs Will you even fight a love
that pleases Do you forget where you live To one
40 side invincible Gaetulians have their towns
wild Numidians and cruel reefs hem us in
opposite are arid lands where Barcans
rampage far and wide Should I mention wars
brewing with Tyre or your brothers threats
I think the Trojan ships followed this heading
with divine support and Junos favor
What a city youll see rise what a kingdom
with this husband and his Trojan soldiers
How Punic glory will soar with such wealth
50 Beg for the gods favor and if you get good omens
be lavish with your guest Find reasons to delay him
while Orions wintry storms rage on the sea
while the boats are damaged and the weather harsh
132

Her words fed the fire of a burning heart
gave hope to hesitation weakened shame
At first they went to shrines and asked for blessings
at the altars They offered chosen sheep to Phoebus
Father Bacchus and to Ceres Lawgiver
but most of all to Juno who minds the marriage bond
60 Lovely Dido held the cup in her right hand
and poured the wine between a snowy heifers horns
She paced along the bloody altars and gods statues
doubled the days offerings and read with care
the throbbing guts of animals laid open
But what can prophets know What use are vows
and shrines to the obsessed The flame devoured
her soft marrow the silent wound throbbed in her heart
Unhappy Dido burned Mad with love she wandered
through the citylike a careless doe pierced by
70 a shepherds arrow from afar as he roams
the Cretan forest with his bow Unknowing
he leaves the shaft behind she bolts through Dictes
groves the fatal arrow in her flank
Now Dido led Aeneas through the fortress
and showed him Sidons riches and her rising city
faltering midsentence as she spoke to him
now she hosted the same banquet when night fell
and madly begged to hear his hardships once again
once again she hung on every word he said
80 When all were gone as the moons dim light died out
and the setting stars urged her to sleep she grieved
alone inside her empty home and threw herself
onto his couch She saw and heard him in his absence
133

or pulled his son onto her lap captured by
the likeness hoping she could cheat her shameful love
The towers stayed halfbuilt the soldiers did no drills
no workers fortified the port and ramparts
for a war Projects were put off the walls
menacing mass the cranes that reached the sky
90 As soon as Juno Jupiters dear wife saw Dido

in the fevers grip saw her reputation
would be no block to passion she accosted Venus
Quite the prize youve won a splendid catch
you and your boy that great divinity
a single woman trapped by two gods tricks
I know quite well you fear my town and hold
the houses of high Carthage in suspicion
But what will be the end of this What will we
achieve Lets aim instead at lasting peace
100 and a pact of marriage You have what you wanted
all this while Dido burns with love frenzy
courses through her bones You and I can rule
this land with equal power Let her serve a Trojan
husband her Tyrians will be his dowry
Venus realized Junos words were insincere
designed to shift Italian might to Libyan shores
So she countered Whod be mad enough
to turn this down or pick a fight with you
so long as Fortune likes this plan of yours
110 But I dont know Fates will Would Jupiter
approve a single city filled with Tyrians
and Trojans mingled peoples joined by a pact
134

Youre his wifeyou try your prayers on him
and Ill take your lead Royal Juno answered
Leave that task to me Now Ill tell you briefly
listen how to make our plan succeed
Aeneas and doomed Dido plan to hunt together
in the forest when tomorrows Titan brings
the dawn and bares the lands with light
120 As the huntsmen run to ring the woods with nets
Ill send down a deluge dark with rain and hail
and shake the sky with thunder The group
will scatter swallowed by black night but Dido
and the Trojan prince will come to the same cave
Ill be there and if youre sure you want this
Ill join them in a stable marriage shell be his
This will be their wedding Venus smiling at
the tricks transparency agreed to this request
Dawn rises over oceans rim and as day breaks
130 a chosen band goes from the city gates to hunt
They have broadbladed spears for game cordons and nets
Massylian riders and keenscented hounds rush out
The Phoenician chiefs wait at the entrance
for the queen who lingers in her bedroom
Her splendid stallion decked in gold and purple
champs fiercely on the foaming bit At last she comes
in a Sidonian cloak with an embroidered edge
her retinue around her Her quivers gold
gold binds her hair a gold brooch pins her purple robe
140 Her Trojan friends approach as does glad Ilus
Aeneas himself handsome past all others
partners her and joins his band with hers
135

Hes like Apollo as he leaves the Lycian winter
and the river Xanthus going to his mothers Delos
to renew the dance At his altars Cretans and
Dryopians and tattooed Agathyrsi roar
The god strides over Cynthus slopes On his flowing
hair young laurel leaves are bound with gold
arrows jangle on his shoulder With such grace
150 Aeneas goes godlike beauty on his face
When they reach the hills and pathless haunts
wild goats disturbed from rocky heights
go bounding down the slopes Elsewhere deer
speed across the open fields in dusty
huddled herds and leave the heights behind
In the valley young Ascanius enjoys
his fiery horse passing others at a gallop
hoping to see a frothing boar among
the docile herds or a tawny mountain lion

160 Meanwhile the sky begins to change Loud rumblings

bring on a sudden storm of rain and hail
They scatter through the fieldsthe Trojan men
the band of Tyrians and Venus Dardan grandson
cowed and seeking cover torrents run down the hills
Dido and the Trojan leader come to the same
cave Ancient Earth and Juno marriage goddess
give the signal Lightning flashes nymphs howl
from the hills the sky is witness to the wedding
This was the first day of death the first cause
170 of ruin Shes unmoved by rumor or appearance
136

and no longer plans to hide her love she says
theyre wed With this word she masks her fault
At once Rumor races through Libyas great
cities Rumor swiftest of all evils she thrives
on speed and gains strength as she goes At first
shes small and scared but soon she rears to the skies
her feet still on the ground her head hidden in clouds
They say that Earth riled to anger at the gods
bore her last Coeus and Enceladuss
180 sister Shes fast of foot and fleet of wing a huge
horrific monster Under all her feathers lurk
amazingly as many watching eyes and tongues
as many talking mouths and prickedup ears
She flies by night between the sky and earth screeching
through the dark Her eyes dont close in welcome sleep
By day she perches as a lookout on high roofs
or towers and alarms great cities Shes as fond
of fiction and perversity as truth And now
she gladly fills the peoples ears with varied
190 stories giving equal time to false and true
Aeneas born of Trojan blood is here
Lovely Dido deigns to sleep with him
they pass the winters length in luxury
unmindful of their kingdoms slaves to shameful lust
The foul goddess spreads this gossip on mens tongues
then quickly turns her path to King Irbas
What she says enflames him and builds up his rage
This man was born to Hammon and a Libyan nymph
hed raped On his sweeping land he built a hundred
137

200 shrines to Jupiter a hundred altars burned

eternally as watchmen for the gods The ground
oozed sacrificial gore the doors were bright with garlands
They say he prayed at length before the divine
images and altars maddened set afire
by the bitter rumor He raised pleading hands
Almighty Jupiter we Moors worship you
with wine when we feast on ornate couches
Do you see this outrage When you hurl your bolts
is our terror pointless Does lightning from the clouds
210 land randomly despite our fear Are its rumblings
empty A woman wandered to my land She paid
to build a paltry town I gave her shores to till
and local laws She scorned my marriage offer
and took Aeneas in her kingdom as her lord
And now That Paris with his retinue of halfmen
a Lydian scarf tied on his oily hair enjoys
what he stole while we bring presents to your
socalled shrines and revere an empty name
The Almighty heard him as he clutched the altars
220 praying Jove turned his gaze to Didos city
and the lovers whod forgotten their good name
Then he ordered Mercury Go my son
call the Zephyrs glide down on your wings
to meet the Dardan leader who expects a future
in Tyres Carthage and ignores the towns chosen
by fate Fly through the rapid breezes with my words
This isnt what his lovely mother promised me
hed be nor why she saved him twice from battle
with the Greeks He was to rule an Italy
138

230 of warcries pregnant with an empire to start a race

from Teucers ancient blood and control the world
If this great venture and its glory leaves him cold
if he wont labor for his own fame does he
grudge Ascanius the citadels of Rome
Whats his plan Why this Libyan loitering
What of Italys new race and the Lavinian
fields He must sail Thats my messagetell him
Mercury prepared to carry out his mighty
fathers order First he bound gold sandals
240 on his feet winged to carry him high over
land and sea as fast as whirlwinds He took
the wand with which he calls pale souls from Orcus
and takes others to grim Tartarus gives sleep
or denies it and opens dead mens eyes
Using this he drove the winds and skimmed
the stormy clouds And now in flight he saw
strong Atlas summit and his sheer slopes
His peak supports the sky dark clouds hug the piney
crest and lash it constantly with wind and rain
250 Snow blankets his shoulders rivers tumble down
his wrinkled chin His beard bristles with ice
Here Mercury first landed hovering
on balanced wings Then he dove down to the ocean
hurling his body headlong like a gull that skims
the shores and reefs where fish abound Just so
between sky and earth the god from Cyllene
flew to Libyas sandy shore parting the winds
leaving behind Atlas the father of his mother
As his winged feet lit down by the city outskirts
139

260 he saw Aeneas building forts and homes

The sword he wore was starred with tawny jasper
the cloak clasped on his shoulders gleamed with purple dye
a gift rich Dido wove for him working the cloth
with golden thread Mercury accosted him
So you lay foundations for high Carthage
Building a fine city acting the good husband
You forget your kingdom and your fate
The ruler of the gods himself whose power moves
the earth and sky sent me down from bright
270 Olympus through the rapid breezes to say this
Whats your plan Why this Libyan loitering
If this great venture and its glory leaves you cold
if you wont labor for your own fame think of
Ascaniuss future the hope of your heir Ilus
hes owed the rule of Italy and the soil
of Rome When Mercury had said this much
he left the sight of mortals with his final words
and vanished into thin air gone from view
The vision stunned Aeneas and struck him senseless
280 His hair stood up his voice stuck in his throat
Aghast at such a warning and the gods command
he burned to get away to leave that land of pleasure
But what should he do With what words approach
the queen who would be furious How begin
He thought quickly weighing all his options
trying different angles turning it all over
As he reflected this decision seemed the best
He called Mnestheus and Sergestus and sturdy
Serestus and told them to prepare the fleet without
140

290 a wordto fetch the men to shore rig the ships and

hide the change of plans Meanwhile since good Dido
would never think their deep love could be severed
hed try to speak to her Hed pick the sweetest
moment and the right tone for his words Swiftly
gladly they obeyed and set to work
But Dido sensed the trick who can deceive
a lover and the launch they planned Now everything
seemed suspect even if it wasnt That same impious
Rumor told the desperate queen the fleet prepared
300 to sail On fire she raved in frenzy through the city
like a Maenad roused by shaken rattles
and the shouts of Bacchus every other year
when revels spur her on and Cithaerons clamor
calls by night At last Dido confronted him
Traitor Were you hoping you could hide
this outrage and sail away without a word
Our love doesnt hold you back nor the pledge
you made me nor the painful death Ill die
Why so quick to rig the fleet when the skies
310 are wintry Why cross the deep when north winds blow
How cruel If you didnt make for foreign fields
and unknown homes and ancient Troy still stood
would you head for Troy across these waves
Is it me you run from By my tears and by your
promise nothing else is left me in my grief
by our wedding by the marriage weve begun
if I deserve anything from you if you
found me at all pleasing pity my poor home
put off your plan I beg if theres still time to beg
141

320 Because of you the Libyan tribes and Nomad kings

detest me and my Tyrians are hostile Because
youre leaving me my honors ruined and my one path
to the starsmy reputation My guest this words
the sad remnant of husband to whom do you
abandon meto what sort of death Should I
await Pygmalion my brother wholl raze my city
Irbas wholl enslave me If at least Id made
a child with you if a small Aeneas played
inside my home who looked like you despite it all
330 I wouldnt feel so lonely and betrayed
She begged But warned by Jupiter he kept
his face unmoved and with effort curbed his feelings
At last he answered briefly Queen Ill never
fault your kindness nor any act you care to list
Ill never regret the memory of you
while I draw breath or remember my own self
A few points in response I didnt try
to sneak away from heredont pretend I did
I never held a husbands torch or made that pact
340 If the fates would let me live the life I wanted
and resolve my worries as Id like
Id first take care of Troy and my peoples
sweet remains Priams high walls would stand
Id build a second Pergamum for the defeated
But as it is Apollo and the oracles
of Lycia have made great Italy my goal
my love my land If the citadels of Carthage
and the vision of your Libyan city hold you
a Phoenician why begrudge Trojans their land
142

350 in Italy We too may seek a foreign kingdom

Whenever nighttime covers Earth with its damp shadows
and shining constellations rise my fathers troubled
ghost alarms me in my dreams He says
Ive harmed my dear son Ascanius by robbing
him of western rule and fated fields And now
the gods own gobetween from Jupiter himself
I swear on both our lives has brought an order
through the rapid breezes I saw him in full
daylight in the city I heard him with these ears
360 Stop enflaming both of us with your complaints
I make for Italy but not of my free will

Shed already turned away watching him
askance her eyes roaming restlessly Now she
scanned him coldly up and down and burst out
angrily Traitor no goddess was your mother
Youre no Dardanian The Caucasus sharp peaks
gave birth to you and Caspian tigers suckled you
Why should I pretend now What could be worse than this
Did he suffer as I wept or look at me
370 or yield to tears and feel pity for his lover
Where should I start Now neither mighty Juno
nor the Father Saturns son takes care of justice
No trust is safe I took him in a beggar cast up
on my shore I gave him half my kingdommadness
I saved his men from death I saved his missing fleet
How this rage rips through me First Apollo then its
Lycian prophecies then sent by Jove himself
143

the gods own messenger brings grim news through the breezes
As if the gods lose sleep or worry over this
380 I wont stop you or refute you Go follow
the winds to Italy chase your kingdom through
the waves If the gods of justice can do anything
I hope reefs bring you your reward Youll cry
Dido often as you drown Ill haunt you with black
flames and when cold death divides my soul and body
my ghost will stalk you everywhere Wicked man
youll pay Ill know the news will come to me in Hell
Heartsick she broke off her speech and rushed
out of his sight gone from the light of day
390 She left him hesitating fearfully planning
to say more Slavewomen took her fainting body
to her marble chamber and set her on her bed
Pious Aeneas wanted to console her pain
and soothe her grief with words Yetthough his great love
shook him to his soulhe groaned and followed
the gods orders going to see the fleet
Now the Trojans fell to work in earnest
Eager to escape they pulled the ships to shore
set afloat the pitchsmeared keels and brought in
400 leafy branches from the woods for making oars
You could see them swarming all over the city
like ants when they pillage a huge heap of grain
mindful of the winter and store it in their home
a long black stream hauls plunder through a narrow
pathway in the grass Some roll giant grains
pushing with their shoulders others mind the line
and chastise stragglers The pathway teems with work
144

What did you feel then Dido as you watched
How did you grieve seeing from your citadel
410 the bustle on the shore before your eyes
seeing the bay alive with so much shouting
Cursed love you make us stoop to anything
Again Didos forced to plead with him and weep
to submit her pride to love and beg
She cant leave any stone unturned her lifes at stake
Anna you see the haste along the shore
They come from everywhere The canvas calls
the winds glad sailors wreathe the sterns Because
I knew this suffering was possible Ill be
420 able to endure it Just do me one favor
in my grief since that liar was your friend
and used to trust you with his private thoughts
Only you could catch him in an easy mood
Go talk to my proud enemy and plead with him
I took no oath at Aulis with the Greeks to ruin
the Trojan race I sent no fleet to Pergamum
I didnt exhume Anchises ghost and ashes
Why does he ignore my words Whats his rush
As a last gift for his grieving lover let him
430 wait for easy sailing and fair winds
Im not begging for the marriage he betrayed
or that he lose his precious empire Latium
I just need time some peace and space for passion
until Fortune teaches me to bear my loss
I ask this final favor have pity for your sister
If he agrees my death will pay him back with interest

145

Her unhappy sister takes these words and tears
to Aeneas many times But no sobs
can move him and hes closed to any plea the fates
440 oppose it and the god stops up his kindly ears
Hes like an oak its wood stronger with age
which Alpine winds try to uproot blasting it
from every side As it creaks leaves from its shaken
trunk lie thick over the ground but the tree sticks
to its crag pushing its crest up to heaven
and its roots as far into deep Tartarus
Though the heros buffeted on every side
by endless pleas and his great heart grieves
his mind remains unmoved the tears are spilled in vain
450 Then unhappy Dido prays for death in earnest

distraught at her fate It sickens her to see
the sky and strange omens fortify her plans
When she sets gifts on the incenseburning altars
the holy water blackens horrible to speak of
the wine she pours turns into filthy gore
She tells no one these sights not even Anna
And besides her home held a marble temple
to her former husband which she honored greatly
decking it with festive wreaths and snowy fleeces
460 From this she seemed to hear her husbands voice
calling her when dark night held the earth
On the roof a lonely owl often cried its
gloomy hoot dragging long notes into sobs
Many other prophecies of seers gone by
scared her with grim warnings In her dreams
fierce Aeneas chased her She always found herself
146

alone on a long road in a frenzy
looking for her Tyrians in desert lands
like mad Pentheus when he sees a throng
470 of Furies two Suns and two Thebes or like Orestes
in a play when hes chased across the stage
his mothers in pursuit armed with torches
and black snakes vengeful Furies block the exit
So in madness grip she decides on death
Her grief has won She secretly mulls over
the right means and moment Then she calls her worried
sister hiding her intent her face serene
with hope Sister wish me joy Ive found a way
to bring him back or be released from love
480 In distant Ethiopia where mighty Atlas
whirls the starry sky upon his shoulder
by the bounds of Ocean and the setting sun
Ive found a priestess from Massylia a guardian
of the zone of the Hesperides feeder
of the serpent there who guards the sacred branches
She sprinkles viscous honey and the sleep of poppies
on its food She claims her spells can ease the cares
of those she chooses and cause deep pain in others
She stops the flow of streams turns back the orbit
490 of the stars and wakes the dead at night Youll see
the earth quake underfoot and ash trees walk down
mountains Dear sister I call the gods and your sweet
self to witness Im forced to arm myself with magic
Go raise a pyre in the inner court under
the open air Add the clothes and weapons he left
in our room impious man and the marriage
147

bed that was my ruin I must wipe out every
memory of that devil as the priestess says
She falls silent pallor sweeps her face
500 Anna cant imagine that these unknown rites
conceal her sisters deathshe cant conceive
of such insanity She fears nothing worse
than when Sychaeus died So she follows orders
The pyre stands in the inner court under the sky
piled high with pine and oak The queen adds wreaths
and crowns it with dark foliage On their bed
she puts his clothes his picture and the sword he left
She knows whats next Altars stand around the pyre
The priestess with loose hair shrieks the titles
510 of three hundred gods Erebus and Chaos
and triform Hecate Dianas triple faces
She scatters drops to symbolize Avernus water
and herbs cut down at moonlight with bronze sickles
bursting with the milk of inky poison
and the warty love charm from the forehead
of a foal torn off before its mother took it
Dido holding holy grain in pious hands
stands by the altar in one sandal her robes loosened
She calls upon the gods and stars that know her fate
520 Then she prays to any divine power whos just
and mindful and cares for unrequited love
Darkness falls Through the land weary creatures
wallow in sweet slumber a hush is on the woods
and restless seas The stars have circled halfway
through their path and every field is still The beasts
148

and brighthued birds who live among the clear lakes
or nest in thorny shrubs sleep in the silent night
But not heartbroken Dido who cant ease into rest
530 who cant let night into her eyes or heart
The pain only grows worse Her love surges again
her great anger ebbs and flows She broods over
her worries turns them over in her heart
What now Should I go back to my old suitors
like a fool and beg to be a Nomad wife
though I rejected them so many times before
Should I board the Trojan fleet and fill
their every wish As if they were grateful
for my help or remembered my warm welcome
540 And if I asked they wouldnt let a hated woman
on their haughty ships Poor thing dont you
know or feel the treachery of Trojans yet
I could leave alone and join the swaggering
sailors or take my Tyrians and my household
with me ordering the group I barely
tore from Sidon to set sail again No
Die as you deserve kill grief by the sword
Sister you did this you yielded to my tears
added ruin to my folly and betrayed me
550 I could have lived in innocence unwed
and free of grief like a creature in the wild
I broke the vow I made Sychaeus ashes
These cries burst from Didos broken heart
while Aeneas slept on his high stern
set on going all the preparations made
As he dreamed the same god came to him
149

and seemed to warn him once again He was
like Mercury in every way his voice
his color and blond hair a handsome youth
560 Goddessborn can you sleep in such a crisis
Are you crazy Dont you see the dangers all
around you or hear the helpful west wind blowing
Shes plotting treachery and terror shes set
on death and feeds the surges of her rage
Wont you get out while you can All too soon
youll see the water churning with her ships
torches burning and the shore seething with flames
if Dawn finds you lingering in these lands Come
No more waiting Females are a fickle thing
570 always prone to change He blended with black night
Aeneas was aghast at the sudden vision
He rose from sleep and roused his crew to action
Wake up men and man the benches Hoist
the sails at once A god sent from the upper air
urges usagainto slash the braided hawsers
and depart at once We follow sacred god
whichever one you are we gladly obey
Stay with us assist us show us helpful
starsigns in the sky He seized his flashing sword
580 and struck the ropes with its bare blade The same
fever gripped them all They rushed to rig the sails
and leave the shore The fleet covered the sea
rowing hard they swept the waves and churned up foam
And now Dawn left Tithonus saffron bed
to pour fresh light upon the land But when
150

Dido from her tower saw the first rays shining
the fleet leaving with hoisted sails and the shore
and harbor empty the crew gone she beat
her lovely chest three and four times and tore
590 her golden hair O Jupiter Will he go then
the foreigner who jeered at my kingdom
Shouldnt we grab every weapon in the city
and give chase Hurry drag ships from the docks
take up torches give out swords pull on your oars
What words are these Where am I Whats this madness
Poor Dido do his impious actions touch you now
Better then when you shared your rule So much
for his pledges the man they say carried his gods
and hauled his father weak with age upon his back
600 I could have seized him hacked him up and thrown his body
in the sea I could have killed his men or
Ascanius himself and served him to his father
I might have failed but I was dying anyhow
Who was there to fear I shouldve torched his camp
and fleet snuffed out father son and all
their race then thrown myself onto the pyre
O Sun who lights the world with flame and Juno
witness to my pain enabler of our love
and Hecate howled to by night on city crossroads
610 and vengeful Furies gods of dying Dido
direct your might at his deserving treachery
and hear my prayers If that cursed man must reach
port and make it to the shore if the fates
of Jupiter demand it and this end is fixed
let him suffer war with daring tribes banished
from his land torn from Ilus embrace
151

Let him beg for help and see the unjust deaths
of friends And when hes yielded to an unfair peace
dont let him enjoy his kingdom or sweet life
620 Let him die too young unburied on the sand
I pour out this final prayer with my lifeblood
Tyrians you must torment his sons and all
his future race Make this offering to my ashes
Let there be no love or treaties between us
Rise up from my bones unknown avenger
hunt the Dardan colonists with flames and swords
now or any times theres strength to strike
My curse is this our lands our seas our swords will clash
The Trojans will fight wars for generations

630 Now Didos thoughts went skidding here and there

How soon could she end her hated life
She spoke briefly to Barce Sychaeus nurse
since her own was black ash in her former land
Nurse dear fetch my sister Anna Tell her
to sprinkle herself with spring water and quickly
bring beasts and offerings for sacrifice
Thats her task You put on a holy headband
My plans to complete the rituals I started
for the Stygian god and end my grief
640 by setting fire to the hateful Trojans pyre
The nurse dashed off with creaky zeal But Dido
wild and trembling at her awful plan
her bloodshot eyes darting around her cheeks
ashen and splotchy at her coming death
152

burst into the inner court and climbed the pyre
beside herself She unsheathed the Dardans sword
a gift not meant for such a use When she
saw the Trojan clothes and wellknown bed
she lingered for a bit with thoughts and tears
650 then lay down and spoke her final words
Sweet remnants of lovesweet while god and fate
allowedtake this soul free me from this grief
Im done with life Ive run the course Fate gave me
Now my noble ghost goes to the Underworld
I built a shining city gazed upon its walls
avenged my husband on my evil brother
happy all too happy if only Trojan keels
had never touched my shores She buried her face
in the bed and cried Ill die though unavenged
660 I choose to join the shades like this Let the cruel
Trojans eyes drink in this fire from the sea
and take with him the evil omen of my death
As she spoke her servants saw her falling
on the sword The blade bubbled with blood
and stained her hands A cry went up in the high hall
Rumors reeled around the shaken city
Houses groaned with grief and womens wails
and the sky echoed the clamor as if Carthage
or ancient Tyre were falling and the enemy
670 were in the cityraging fires rolling through
the homes of men and temples of the gods
Her sister heard the noise and ran half dead with fear
She cut through the crowd raking her face with nails
pummeling her breast and cried to dying Dido
This was your plan my sister You wanted to trick me
153

The pyre the flames and altar were for this
You left me with so much to grieve for Did you
scorn my company Id have shared your fate
one pain one sword one instant should have taken us
680 Did I build the pyre and call upon our gods
just to be absent heartlessly as you lay here
Youve destroyed us both sister and our people
and the elders and your city Let me wash
your wounds with water let me touch my lips
to your last breath She climbed the steps and held
her dying sister stroking her and sobbing
staunching the dark blood with her own dress
Dido tried to lift her heavy eyes again
she couldnt The deep wound hissed inside her chest
690 Three times she tried to rise leaning on her elbow
three times she fell back on the bed With dimming eyes
she sought the light of sky found it and groaned
Then almighty Juno pitying her long
and painful death sent Iris from Olympus
to free the trapped soul from its mortal bonds
Because her death poor thing was not deserved
or fated but premature and in the heat of passion
Proserpina hadnt plucked one of her golden
hairs yet nor condemned her soul to Stygian Orcus
700 So dewy Iris flew down on her saffron wings
trailing a thousand colors through the sunlight
She stopped over her head I take this offering
down to Dis as told and free you from your body
She cut a strand of hair At once all warmth
slipped away Didos life ebbed to the winds
154

BOOK 5


Aeneas and his crew sailed out to sea
Resolute he cut through waters dark with wind
gazing back at city walls lit up by flames
poor Didos pyre No one knew what caused the blaze
but they knew the great grief of a love betrayed
and what a womans passion could unleash
Their hearts were somber with foreboding
When deep sea held the ships and no land could
be seenjust sky and sea on every side
10 dark rainclouds settled overhead bringing night
and storm the waves bristled with shadow
The pilot Palinurus cried from his high stern
Why so many cloudbanks closing on the sky
What awaits us father Neptune He told the crew
to trim the sails and bend to the strong oars
bearing down out of the wind and said Brave
Aeneas not even if Jupiter would promise
could I hope for Italy under these skies
The winds have changed and roar across our path
20 from the dark west the air thickens to mist
We cant resist or hold our course Fortune
has defeated us lets follow where she calls

155

The friendly shores and harbor of Sicilian Eryx
are close if I remember rightly and can trace
our journey back by the same stars I charted here
Pious Aeneas replied Thats what these winds call for
Ive watched you struggle vainly for some time
Change your route No country has a greater
call on me theres no place Id rather dock
30 our tired ships more than Acestes homeland
whose soil cradles the bones of my father
They made for port The west winds now welcome
filled the sails the ships rode swiftly on the swells
At last with joy they landed on familiar shores
From a far hill Acestes marveled at their coming
and went to meet the allied shipsa rough sight
with his spears and Libyan shebears pelt
Crinisus a rivergod had sired him on
a Trojan mother Mindful of his parents
40 he rejoiced at their return glad to help
the weary men with pleasing rustic riches
When Easts bright dawn had driven out the stars
Aeneas called the sailors to him from across
the shore standing on a knoll to speak
Great Dardans noble race of divine blood
a year has passed the months have turned full circle
since we put my godlike fathers bones in earth
and offered sacrifice on his sad altars Unless
Im wrong that day is here Ill always count it bitter
50 but Ill always honor it as the gods wished
On this daywhether I roamed the Libyan shoals
156

in exile or were caught at sea or prisoned
in MycenaeId observe my vow to offer
annual rites and heap the altar with due gifts
We stand before my fathers very bones and ash
It was the will and power of the gods I think
that let us travel to a friendly port So come
lets conduct this ceremony gladly
Well ask for winds and when our citys built
60 I hope to honor him in his own temple yearly
Trojanborn Acestes offers you two bulls
for every ship Summon our native gods
to feast and those our host worships as well
If the ninth days dawn brings gentle weather
and the suns rays light our mortal earth
Ill hold Trojan contestsfirst for the quick ships
then the fastest runner then for someone strong
and skilled with spears or flying arrows or
brave at landing blows with rawhide boxinggloves
70 All of you come try to win a palm as prize
And now hush wreathe your heads with leaves
Aeneas bound his brow with Venus myrtle
So did old Acestes Helymus and young
Ascanius The others followed suit Then he
left the gathering going to the grave mound
many thousands crowding all around him
Now he duly poured onto the soil two bowls
each of unmixed wine fresh milk and holy blood
He scattered purple flowers and prayed Sacred
80 father once again I greet your ashes shade
and spirit you whom I saved from Troybut why
157

since I was not allowed to look for Italy
with you or those fated fields or the unknown
Tiber At his words a glistening snake slid out
from the tombs base drawing seven giant coils
It calmly circled round the mound and altars
Its back was mottled with blue spots its scales
gleamed bright with goldlike clouds behind a rainbow
colored by the suns rays with a thousand hues
90 Aeneas was stupefied to see it The snakes
long body glided through the polished cups
and bowls It tried the feast and harmlessly
went back inside the tomb leaving the altars
Aeneas renewed his fathers rites with still more zeal
uncertain if the serpent was the places spirit
or Anchises He duly killed two sheep two sows
two heifers with black hides and poured the wine
from bowls calling on the soul of great
Anchises the shade he wished to come from Acheron
100 His men gladly offered gifts from what they had
They heaped the altars high and killed the bulls
Others spread out through the grass lined up
cauldrons or roasted spitted meat on coals
The day theyd waited for arrived Phathons horses
brought the ninth dawn and a cloudless sky
Acestes fame his noble name had roused
the local people They thronged along the shore
glad to see Aeneas menand to compete
First trophies were put out for all to see
110 sacred tripods palms and leafy crowns
prizes for the winners as well as weapons
158

robes dyed purple gold and silver bars
The bugle rang out from a mound the games were on
Four matching ships with heavy oars were chosen
from the fleet to enter the first race
Mnestheus led the Krakens eager crewhed be
Italys Mnestheus of the Memmi clan
Gyas led the giant ship Chimaera its bulk
huge as a city A Dardan crew propelled its
120 triple rows of oars and triple decks
Sergestus founder of the Sergian clan captained
the massive Centaur On the seagreen Scylla
rode Cloanthusyour ancestor Cluentius
Far out to sea a boulder faced the foaming shore
At times when swollen waters pounded it and
winter winds concealed the stars it was submerged
In calmer skies its level crown rose peacefully
above the sea a pleasant stop for sunning gulls
Here Aeneas propped a leafy oakbranch a living
130 marker it was the sailors sign to turn around
and circle back on their long course Starting spots
were set by lot Far off on the sterns
the captains stood out in their gold and purple
The crews were crowned with poplar leaves their bare backs
glistened rubbed with oil They took up seats
along the benches arms taut on the oars and waited intent
on the signal Their hearts pounded fiercely
tense and desperate with desire for glory
When the piercing bugle sang the ships sprang
140 forward from their berths The sailors cries struck
159

the high skies taut arms strained to churn the sea
plowing paths in parallel tearing furrows
in the sea with oars and threepronged beaks
Not even speeding chariots springing
from their stalls devour racetracks with such speed
when the drivers strike their team with rippling reins
and lean forward to snap the horses with the lash
All the grove was roaring with the shouts
and cheers of fans The sheltered shores echoed their cries
150 The din pounded the hills and set them ringing
As the crowd erupted Gyas left the rest behind
and took the lead Cloanthus was in second place
His crew was better but his boat was sluggish
from its weight Behind them neck to neck
Centaur vied with Kraken trying to seize the lead
First Kraken then huge Centaur ran ahead
Then both raced together prows aligned
They split the salt sea with long keels As they
neared the reefs closing on the turningpost
160 Gyas leading at the midpoint of the race
rebuked his pilot Menoetes Why so far
to starboard Steer this way Hug the reef
have the port oars graze it Let the other boats stay
farther out But Menoetes feared the lurking
rocks and pulled the prow back out to sea
Gyas cried again Youre off the course
Steer for the rocksand now he saw Cloanthus
on his tail steering a tighter tack cutting
to the left between the roaring rocks and
170 Gyas shipand he glided to the front
160

getting to safe water leaving the post behind
That was the last straw Gyas flared up in
a fury tears wetting his cheeks Forgetting
dignity and the safety of his crew he shoved
slow Menoetes from the stern into the sea
and took the rudder himself urging on his team
turning the tiller shoreward When Menoetes
heavy surfaced from the depths at last
an old man dripping in drenched clothes he struggled
180 to the level rock and sat on its dry crown
As he fell as he swam the Trojans laughed
They laughed to see him vomit floods of sea
Sergestus and Mnestheus in last place
rejoiced at the chance to overtake slow Gyas
Near the rocks Sergestus took the lead
He was ahead but not yet by a boatlength
His rival Krakens prow was closing on him
Mnestheus strode midships among his oarsmen
urging them Nows the time to bend to oars
190 men of Hector whom I picked as comrades
in Troys final hour Use the strength and spirit
you had in Libyas shallows the Ionian sea
and the greedy waves of Cape Malea
I dont aim for victory and first place now
and yetbut only you pick victors Neptune
but being last means disgrace Fight it men
avoid this ignominy All bent to oars
in fierce rivalry The bronze stern shuddered
with great strokes and the sea flew by Gasps shook
200 their bodies and dry mouths their sweat ran in streams
161

And now chance brought the glory they desired
Sergestus succumbed to lunacy and drove
his boat still closer to the rocks and into danger
Unhappy manhis boat rammed onto jutting reefs
The rocks shook and the oars snapped on sharp edges
The damaged prow was wedged in place With a shout
the crew leapt up to deal with the delay
and pulled the shattered oars in from the sea
with ironplated poles and sharptipped hooks
210 Mnestheus good luck here made him even keener
A swift pull of oars with the winds he prayed for
put him near the shore as he returned
like a dove abruptly startled from her nest
where she and her sweet chicks hide in the rocks
Flushed out she darts in fear to the fields
beating her wings loudly but soon she glides
along the steady air and skims a skyblue path
So Mnestheus Kraken heading homeward
cut the waves gliding after her first spurt
220 He left Sergestus struggling in the spiky reefs
and shallows calling out for help in vain
learning how to race with broken oars
Next Mnestheus chased Chimaeras giant bulk
The boat had no pilot and Gyas fell behind
Now only Cloanthus led already near
the goal Mnestheus made a massive effort

At this the shouting doubled They all cheered
the ship in second place the sky echoed the din
162

One crew would hate to lose the glory of an honor
230 all but won Theyd trade their lives for victory
The others were encouraged by success Belief in
victory spurred them on And perhaps theyd have
pulled ahead and won but Cloanthus stretched
both hands to the waves and poured out prayers
Rulers of the sea whose waters I now sail
on shore Ill gladly kill a white bull at your altars
Ill pay this vow then throw the entrails in your
briny waves and pour you unmixed wine
Beneath the sea Phorcus choir the Nereds
240 and the virgin Panopea heard him
Father Portunus himself propelled the boat
ahead Quicker than south winds or flying arrows
the vessel sped to land and settled in the harbor
Then Anchises son summoning them all
had the herald loudly proclaim Cloanthus
as the victor and veiled his brow with living laurel
The crews picked prizes for their ships for each
wine three bulls and a large silver ingot
Special gifts went to the captains for the winner
250 a goldstitched cloak richly worked along the edge
with Meliboean purple in a double wave
A boy was woven on it the prince of leafy Ida
chasing swift stags with his spearyou could almost
hear him gasp An eagle bearer of Joves bolt
plummeted to grab him with hooked claws
The aged guardians vainly raised their hands
to heaven and dogs barked madly at the sky
The man in second place received a breastplate
made of golden chain mail three layers thick
163

260 which Aeneas himself had ripped from Demoleos

when he beat him near high Troys Simos both
a thing of beauty and protection in a battle
His slaves Phegeus and Sagaris could barely
hold it on their shoulders but when Demoleos
wore it he chased straggling Trojans at a run
Third place was a matched pair of bronze cauldrons
and cups of silver that were rough with carved reliefs
As they were proudly leaving with their prizes
all with purple ribbons round their temples
270 Sergestus who for all his skill had barely wrenched
his ship off the sharp reefs now pulled into harbor
mocked pride lost oars gone one tier disabled
Just like a snake a bronze wheel crushes on the road
or one smashed by a travelers cruel stone
mangled and halfdead its desperate
to glide away but cant It keeps coiling
its long body fiercely rearing up its neck
hissing eyes like fire but the maimed part drags it
down and the snake weaves knots and falls back
280 on itselfso the ship limped under oars
Still it spread full sails and reached the port
Aeneas gave Sergestus the gift hed pledged happy
that the ship was safe the crew on land
The prize was a Cretan slave girl handy in
Minervas work Pholo she nursed twin sons
The contest over pious Aeneas headed
to a grassy field hemmed in by woods
and curving hills The middle of this valley
formed a natural racetrack The hero arrived
164

290 many thousands with him and sat on a raised seat

He offered gifts to lure any brave souls
eager to compete in running and displayed
the prizes Trojans and Sicilians gathered
from all sides First Nisus and Euryalus
the latter marked by beauty and green youth
Nisus by his pious love for him Next
prince Diores of Priams royal line
then Salius and Patron the first Acarnian
the other a Tegean of Arcadian blood
300 Next were two Sicilians the woodsmen Helymus
and Panopes followers of old Acestes
and many others lost since to tradition
Among them all Aeneas said Listen to
my words youll be glad to hear them Not one
of you will leave without a prize from me
Each man will get two Cretan arrows bright
with polished iron and a doubleheaded ax
embossed in silver same for all The first three
will get extra gifts and olive wreaths to wear
310 First place wins a horse with gorgeous trappings
Second place an Amazonian quiver
full of Thracian arrows with a broad gold strap
tied with a shining gemstone clasp The man
whos third will leave happy with this Argive helmet
They took their spots At the signal suddenly
they sprang out from the gates and sped over
the distance rushing on like stormclouds When they
saw the finish line Nisus flashed into
first place faster than winged lightning and
165

320 the wind Next but next by a long interval

came Salius Further back Euryalus
was third Helymus right behind him Diores
was on Helymuss heels in turn
looming at his shoulderand if the track
were longer hed have edged in front of him
or left in doubt who won third place And now
almost at the very end they were closing
on the goal exhausted when unlucky
Nisus skidded in a pool of slippery blood
330 where bulls slaughtered for a sacrifice
had soaked the ground and lush green grass with gore
He was already relishing his victory
when he fell going down facefirst
He lay there in the filthy dung and sacred gore
Even so he remembered his love for
Euryalus Rising from the slime he tripped
Salius who went tumbling to the earth
To applause and friendly cheers Euryalus
raced on to the triumph Nisus had granted
340 Next was Helymus Diores took third
But Salius deafened the giant stadium
and the elders in front with loud cries his prize
was stolen from him by a trick Euryalus
popularity and graceful tears protected
himand his purity so lovely in a
lovely boy Diores loudly backed him up
hed lose third prize if Salius won first
Father Aeneas said Your gifts are safely yours
No one will change the list of winners But I
350 can pity the misfortune of my blameless friend
166

He gave Salius the huge pelt of a Libyan
lion a load of shaggy fur and gilded claws
Then Nisus said If the losers get such prizes
because you pity stumblers what gift do I deserve
Id have won the crown of victory
if not for the same bad luck that Salius had
He showed his face and body slimed with filthy dung
Aeneas best of leaders laughed and had
a shield fetched Didymans work torn
360 by Trojans from the temple door of Neptune
He gave the fine young man this gorgeous gift

The race was over and the gifts distributed
Now he said If theres a man of ready heart
and courage come wrap your hands in hide put up
your fists He set out double prizes for the boxing
a bull with gilded horns and garlands for the victor
a sword and handsome helmet to console the loser
At once the strongman Dares lifted up his head
and stood A murmur rippled through the crowd
370 He was the only one whod boxed with Paris
Hed knocked out the champion Butes a giant
who claimed his lineage from Bebrycian
Amycus and laid him dying on the yellow
sand near the mound that held great Hector
Such was the towering man who stood to fight
He showed his muscled shoulders stretching out
his arms in turn throwing punches in the air
He needed a rival but who from that huge crowd
167

would dare to face the man and bind their hands with leather
380 Thinking everyone had yielded him the prize
Dares stepped up at once to where Aeneas sat
grabbed the prize bull by the horn and said
Goddessborn if no one dares to fight with me
how long must I stand I shouldnt have to wait
Let me take the prize All the Trojans roared
in favor he should be given what was promised
But Acestes raked Entellus with harsh words
as they sat together on their grassy bench
Entellus whats the point of your great past
390 if you meekly let this great prize go without
a fight What happened to your idol the trainer
Eryx Was he famous for no reason What of
your glory throughout Sicily the prizes hanging
in your house He answered Fear hasnt dulled
my love of glory but my blood is sluggish
with the slowness of old age My strength is gone
If I were in my youth the same age that scoundrel
trusts in as he preens if I were like that
it wouldnt take a prize for me to fight or some
400 fancy steer I dont care about the gifts
He flung into the ring immensely heavy boxing
gloves that fierce Eryx had worn in his matches
when hed bound his hands with the hard hide
The crowd gasped at the huge gloves made of pelts
from seven giant bulls stiff with lead and iron
Dares himself gaped the most and backed away
Greatsouled Aeneas handled the gloves weight
the great mass of twisted bands of leather
168

The old boxer said with spirit Imagine if
410 youd seen the gloves of Hercules himself
the grim struggle on this very shore
Your brother Eryx wore these gloves look
theyre smeared with blood and splattered brains
to face great Hercules and I wore them
while I still had strength and younger blood
before old age sprinkled white hairs on my head
But if my gloves scare Trojan Dares and
pious Aeneas and Acestes are agreed
lets fight on equal terms Ill give up Eryx
420 gloves fear not and you take off your Trojan ones
He threw the lined cloak from his shoulders baring
his huge frame his giant limbs and muscles
and stood hulking in the center of the sand
Father Aeneas brought out matching gloves
and bound the hands of both with equal weight
They stood on tiptoes holding their arms high up
to the sky Then they bobbed around
keeping their heads out of range feinting
with their hands sparring for an opening
430 Dares youth made him better on his feet
Entellus strength was in his arms and bulk
but his stiff knees shook gasps racked his huge frame
The men threw many useless punches but landed
many too hitting hollow flanks thumping
each others chests Often their hands strayed
to ears and heads Their jaws rattled with the impact
Entellus solid and unmoving stayed in place
dodging blows by watching carefully and twisting
Dares looked like he was laying siege and placing
169

440 catapults around a mountain fort or town

He tried this route and that probing everywhere
with skill pressing him with varied jabsno luck
Entellus rose and raised his right arm high
but Dares saw the blow aimed from above
and nimbly dodged it The man squandered his strength
on the air and worse still himself heavy tumbled
heavily his vast bulk landing on the ground
like a pine hollowed with age and torn up by
the roots on Mount Erymanthus or great Ida
450 Excited Trojans and Sicilians leapt up
their shouts rose to the sky Acestes feeling pity
quickly ran to lift his old friend from the ground
But the hero wasnt slowed or scared by falling
He came back fiercer his anger brought him strength
Shame kindled him and trust in his own skill
He chased Dares round the ring in fury landing
endless blows with both his fists There was no pause
no chance to rest He was like a hailstorm
rattling roofsso dense were the punches that
460 the hero rained on Dares pounding him all over
Father Aeneas didnt let this fury last
Entellus was berserk with bitter rage
He stopped the match pulling out exhausted
Dares and soothed him with these words Poor man
have you lost your mind Dont you see
his strength is not his own but backed by gods
Give in to their power So the contest ended
Dares faithful friends hauled him to the ships
His knees couldnt support him and his head flopped
170

470 side to side He was vomiting thick clots

of blood and teeth His helpers were called back
to fetch the sword and helmet but the palm and bull
were for Entellus He was in high spirits
puffed up by his prize Goddessborn Aeneas
and you Trojans see what strength I had
when young see the death from which youve rescued
Dares Then he stood before the bullock
his prize for victory pulled back his right fist
and slammed the heavy glove between its horns
480 The skull caved in spilling out the brains
and the bull collapsed to earth and twitched in death
Over it he poured these heartfelt words Eryx
I offer you this life for Dares better so
I won Now Ill retire my gloves and talent
Aeneas next invited anyone who wanted
to compete in archery and named the prizes
With great strength he lifted the mast from Sergestus
ship Feeding a rope through the top
he attached a fluttering dove their arrows goal
490 The contestants came and threw their lots
in a bronze helmet To loud cheers first place
went to Hippocon Hyrtacus son Next
Mnestheus whod placed in the ship race still wreathed
with the olive leaves around his brow
Eurytion was thirdfamed Pandarus brother
who was told to break the treaty back at Troy
and aimed his bow into the mass of Greeks
Last from the deep helmet came Acestes name
He too dared to try the task of younger men
171

500 Each man bent his pliant bow putting muscle

into it pulling arrows from his quiver
From the twanging bow of young Hippocon
the first vibrating shaft sliced through the air
It flew straight to the wooden mast and stuck
As the mast shuddered the dove fluttered
in fear The whole place rang with loud applause
Next keen Mnestheus stood and drew his bow
He pointed high aiming both eye and arrow
at the mark He didnt manage to impale
510 the birdbad luckbut he broke the knotted rope
around her foot that tied her to the mast
The dove released flew southward to dark clouds
Eurytion had long since held his arrow taut
and his bow drawn Praying to his brother
he peered for the dove as she beat her wings
in joy in the empty sky rising to the night
and shot her She fell lifeless leaving her soul
in the stars returning the lodged arrow
Acestes was still there but the prize was gone
520 He shot his arrow to the heavens anyhow
to show his veteran skill and ringing bow
And then a sudden miracle took place important
in the futureas its fulfillment showed
when stern prophets at last knew its meaning
Soaring through the empty sky the arrow
blazed a flaming path then vanished in the breeze
like a shooting star falling from the heavens
that draws its shining trail across the sky
The Trojans and Sicilians were amazed
172

530 and called upon the gods Great Aeneas did not

reject the omen He hugged happy Acestes
heaping him with lavish gifts and said
Take these father The great king of Olympus
shows by such signs youll win honors like no
other This prize belonged to aged Anchises
a bowl embossed with figures Thracian Cisseus
gave it him long ago a handsome gift
a token of himself and a pledge of love
He ringed Acestes brows with living laurel
540 and named him winner first among them all
Good Eurytion readily gave up his place
though he alone shot down the soaring bird
The man who broke the rope was next in gifts
last the one whose arrow was wedged in the mast
Before the contest ended Aeneas summoned Ilus
friend and guardian Epytides and told
those loyal ears Go and tell Ascanius
if his boy troops are prepared and their horses
marshaled in straight rows to lead them in
550 and show himself in armor in honor of his
grandfather He told the crowd packed in the lengthy
circuit to clear out leaving the fields empty
The boys advanced before their parents eyes
shining on their bridled horses Trojans and
Sicilians roared in admiration as they passed
Their hair was bound with cropped wreaths in the old way
Each held double irontipped cornel lances
some slung polished quivers on their back
Soft coils of twisted gold sat on their collarbones
173

560 Three squadrons with three captains galloped in

Twelve boys were in each group The separate ranks
gleamed brightly following their leaders One glad
troop of boys was led by little Priam
his grandfathers namesakePolitus child future
father of Italians He rode a Thracian horse
a tall prancing piebald with white brow and
pasterns Next came Atys The Latin Atii
trace their clan and ancestry to him
little Atys a boy loved by the boy Ilus
570 Last and handsome past the rest Ilus
steered a Sidonian horse that lovely Dido
gave him to remember her a pledge of love
The others rode on old Acestes native
steeds The Dardans watching clapped to see
the anxious boys feeling joy at the sight
young faces that recalled passed generations
Happy on their horses the boys circled the field
before their parents eyes From a distance
Epytides yelled and cracked his whip the sign
580 Each troop split in equal halves who rode apart
At the call they wheeled back to meet again
and charged with spearsa military tactic
One side wove a pattern the other mirrored it
They formed intersecting circles riding left
and right Their play looked like armed battle
At times they risked their backs in flight at times attacked
with swords at times rode in peaceful pairings
Just so the Labyrinth in high Crete they say
was woven of blind walls its paths an enigma
590 of a thousand forking ways that foiled all clues
174

each slip uncaught and irrevocable
The sons of Troy tangled their horses paths
weaving battles and retreats in play
like dolphins cutting Libyan and Carpathian waters
as they skim the seas and breach the waves
Ascanius renewed this custom and this contest
for his horsemen when he circled Alba Longa
with her walls He taught the native Latins
to observe it as he did with the young Trojans
600 The Albans taught their own children great Rome
inherited and kept the ancient ritual
The boys now stand for Troy the troops are Trojan
These were the games observed in honor of Anchises
And now Fortune changed and showed her perfidy
As they performed games for the annual rites Juno
hurried Iris earthward to the Trojan fleet
backing her with wind scheming not yet
satiated in her ancient grudge
Iris flew along the rainbows thousand hues
610 Her quick descent was seen by none She sighted
the giant gathering and on the shore
the deserted harbor the abandoned fleet
On the empty beach the Trojan women
wept for lost Anchises looking at the ocean
through their tears They deplored the many reefs
and voyages that faced their weary people still
Sick of sea and hardship they longed to settle
Iris mixed among them no novice in the art
of harm She shed her goddesss clothes and face
620 and became Bero Doryclus old wife
175

whod once had a family and famous sons
She pushed through the Trojan women saying
Unlucky us that Greek hands didnt haul us off
to die in war beneath our countrys walls
Unhappy race what does Fortune have in store
This is the seventh summer since Troys fall and still
we bear this journey through the lands and seas
the hostile reefs and skies chasing receding
Italy through endless seas Were on land
630 owned by our kinsman Eryx and our host Acestes
Wholl stop us from laying walls for our own town
O fatherland and gods saved from the Greeks in vain
will no city be called Troy Will we never
see Simos and Xanthus Hectors rivers
Come help me set these cursed ships on fire
In my sleep I saw the prophetess Cassandra
handing me lit torches Seek Troy here she said
This is your home Nows the time for action
such omens call for no delay I see right here
640 four altars raised to Neptune Hell give us fireand daring
She was the first to seize a deadly torch
With effort she held it high swung it and threw
The women were shocked and stupefied
Now the oldest woman in the crowd
Pyrgo royal nurse to many sons of Priam
said Women this is not Doryclus wife
Bero Note the signs of divine beauty
her burning eyes her bravery Look at
her face how she sounds and how she walks
650 I myself just left Bero She was sick
and sad that she alone would miss the rites
176

and could not pay Anchises his due honors
At first the women were divided they stared
at the ships with angry looks torn between
fierce longing for their present spot
and the lands to which Fate called Iris rose up
through the sky on level wings and as she left
she drew a massive rainbow in the clouds
Now they shouted louder maddened by
660 the omen Some snatched fire from nearby hearths
others robbed the altars They hurled branches leaves
and burning torches at the ships Fire raged
amok over the seats and oars and painted sterns
Eumelus brought the message to the gathering
around Anchises tomb the ships were burning
Looking back they saw a rising billow of black ash
Ascanius just now happily leading
his troops galloped fiercely to the chaos
at the ships His breathless guardians couldnt catch him
670 Whats this new madness my poor citizens he cried
What are you doing Its not hostile camps of Greeks
you set on fire its hope itself Look Im your
Ascanius He threw his helmet at his feet
the one he wore to play at battle Aeneas
and a band of Trojans rushed up too
But the women scattered fearfully along
the shore to hide in any rocky nook or wood
They shunned daylight and their deed Sane again
Juno driven from their hearts they knew the men
680 But this didnt stop the flames or sap their wild

177

strength Beneath the sodden wood the pitch
was live spewing smoke and smoldering
eating at the hulls wrecking the ships frames
Heroic strength and streams of water were no use
Pious Aeneas tore his clothing from his chest
stretched out his hands and begged the gods for help
Almighty Jupiter if you dont hate the Trojans
one and all if your former piety
still cares for human suffering let our ships
690 survive save our fragile hopes from death
Or if we merit it kill whats left of us
with your deadly bolt drown us by your hand
Hed hardly finished when a dark storm broke out
with a violent downpour The fields and steep hills
shook with thunder Dark rain poured in sheets
across the sky driven by the strong south wind
The ships filled up with water It soaked their halfburned
timbers until all the smoke and flames were out
The hulls except for four were saved from ruin

700 Aeneas was shattered by this bitter loss

His grave concerns pulled him this way and that
Should they forget their destiny and stay
in Sicily or aim for the Italian coast
Then old Nautes Athenas only student
whod been famous for his foresight the goddess
always told him what the gods great rage
would bring and what the chain of fate required
this Nautes comforted Aeneas Goddessborn
178

lets follow where fate draws us even if we backtrack
710 Come what may well win out by endurance
Dardanian Acestes comes from divine stock
Entrust this willing partner with your plans
and set him over those whove lost their ships
or are sick of your great project and your fate
Pick old men and women wearied by the sea
all the weak all who fear the risks
and let these tired people have their city here
if you permit theyll call the place Acesta
His old friends advice disturbed Aeneas
720 and now his worries tore at him still more
As black Night in her chariot drove across
the heavens suddenly the image of Anchises
his father came to him descending from the skies
Son dearer than my life while I had life
so troubled by Troys fate I visit you
at Jupiters command He drove the fire
from your ships at last showing pity
Follow the fine counsel that old Nautes gives
take only chosen men the bravest hearts
730 to Italy In Latium therell be a harsh
and rustic race for you to crush But first
come to Diss hellish home Ill be by deep
Avernus Impious Tartaruss sullen shades
dont keep me Elysiums my home and the lovely
gatherings of the good Chaste Sibyl will bring you
once youve offered pools of blood from blackskinned sheep
Youll learn about your people and your city
Now goodbye damp Night wheels in her midcourse
179

I can feel the breath of cruel Dawns horses
740 He dissolved like smoke into thin air
Aeneas cried Now where are you rushing
and from whom Who stops us from embracing
Then he woke the sleeping fires embers
and humbly worshiped Trojan Lar and whitehaired
Vestas shrine with sacred grain and incense
Next Aeneas called his friends Acestes first
to tell them Jupiters command his dear
fathers guidance and what he had decided
Their debate was short Acestes said yes
750 They formed a colony of women and the willing
people with no need for boundless glory
The rest repaired the rowers benches and the timbers
eaten by the fire adding new oars and ropes
They were few but spirited in war
Aeneas sketched out city limits with a plow
assigning homes He called the districts Ilium
and Troy Trojan Acestes loved his kingdom
He formed a court and gave laws to new senators
On Eryx summit near the stars they built a shrine
760 to Venus of Idalia A priest and sacred
grove were granted to Anchises tomb
Now nine days of feasting passed The altars
had been honored and calm winds smoothed the seas
The south wind called them to the deep again
A gale of lament went up along the curving
shore they embraced delayed a day and night
The very men and mothers whod found the sea
180

too harsh the gods power unbearable
now wanted to endure the pain of exile
770 In tears himself good Aeneas offered comfort
with kind words and left them with Acestes
He ordered three calves killed for Eryx a lamb
for the Storms Then he had the mooring loosened
He stood high on the prow holding a bowl
his head ringed with olive leaves and poured
clear wine and entrails on the briny sea
Eagerly the sailors swept the sea with oars
As they sailed a fair wind rose behind them
But meanwhile Venus distraught went to speak
780 to Neptune She poured out passionate complaints
Neptune Junos fierce rage and stubborn heart
force me to stoop to every kind of plea
Times passage doesnt soften her nor piety
Shes unbowed by Jupiters commands and Fate
Her malice has devoured a Phrygian city
dragged the scraps of Troy through every torture
But thats not enoughshe persecutes dead bones
and ashes Her rage makes sense to her alone
You saw yourself the trouble she caused recently
790 on the Libyan waves mingling sea and sky
unwisely betting on Aeolus storms
She dared this in your realm She even set
the Trojan women on a path of crime
they burned the ships sank the fleet and forced
the men to leave their friends on unknown shores
I beg of you let the rest sail safely
let them reach Laurentian Tiberif this is right
181

if the goddesses of Fate give them this city
Then Saturns son tamer of the deep seas said

800 Youve every right to trust my kingdom Venus

you were born in it And Ive earned this trust
Ive often stopped the sky and seas great frenzy
On land no less I helped Aeneas Simos
and Xanthus can attest to it When Achilles
pinned the panicked Trojans to the walls
sending thousands to their deaths stopping up
the groaning streams so Xanthus couldnt reach
the sea I rescued Aeneas in a cloud
as he fought brave Achilles a greater man
810 in strength and dearer to the gods even though
I wanted to uproot Troys lying wallsthe walls
I built I havent changed my mind let go your fear
Hell reach Avernus harbor safely as you wish
Therell only be one man to mourn for lost at sea
One life will pay for many So Neptune soothed
and cheered the goddesss heart Then he yoked
his wild horses with their golden harness
damp with foam and fed out rein He sped across
the oceans surface in his seablue chariot
820 Under the thundering axles waves sank down
swells subsided and the clouds dissolved
Up came his manyshaped companions giant whales
Glaucus old troop Palaemon Inos son
speedy Tritons all of Phorcus army Thetis
Panopea and Melite at his left
182

Thalia Nesaea Cymodoce Spio
At this a calm joy lulled Aeneas anxious mind
He ordered that the masts be raised at once
and the sails be stretched out on the yardarms
830 As one the crew hauled on the ropes letting out
the canvas to the left and right As one
they turned the high yards fair winds moved the fleet
Palinurus in the front led the dense
armada The rest were told to tack his course
Damp Night was near the midpoint of the sky
and the sailors sprawling by their oars
on rigid benches were resting peacefully
when Sleep gliding from the stars above
breached the dark and chased away the shadows
840 looking for you Palinurus bringing fatal
slumber to a guiltless man In Phorbas shape
the god sat on the ships high stern and made his pitch
Palinurus Isus son the seas themselves
propel us the winds blow evenlytheres time to rest
Lay down your head steal your tired eyes from work
Ill take on your duties for a while
Palinurus barely glanced at him You ask
me of all men to trust the seas calm face
and quiet waves to have faith in this monster
850 As if Id leave Aeneas to the lying breezes
The clear skies treachery has fooled me many times
He held the tiller tight not letting go
and fixed his eyes upon the stars above
Then the god shook over him a branch that dripped
with Lethes dew and drugs of Stygian strength
183

It shut his swimming eyes against his will
Hed hardly slumped in unexpected rest
when Sleep bent over him and pitched him in the sea
As he fell he ripped the rudder from the stern
860 calling often on his friends but unheard
Sleep rose on his wings into the sheer air
and the fleet sailed on as safely as before
unperturbed as father Neptune had assured
As Aeneas ship approached the Sirens crags
once treacherous and white with many bones
where boulders battered by the surf roared endlessly
he realized he was drifting with no pilot Groaning
deeply he himself took up the helm across
the midnight sea sick at heart for his friends fate
870 Ah Palinurus rashly trusting in calm winds
and sky youll lie unburied on an unknown shore

184

BOOK 6


So he said in tears and gave the fleet free rein
At last they glided into Cumaes bay
and turned the prows to face the sea The anchors
bite secured the ships the shore was fringed
with curving keels Young men sprang out eagerly
onto the sand of Italy Some tried to strike out
sparks from flints deep veins others scoured the forest
home to many beasts or noted streams theyd found
Pious Aeneas made for great Apollos temple
10 and the vast cave nearby the sanctuary
of dread Sibyl into whom the Delian seer
breathes his mind and mission unveiling the future
They neared the goldroofed temple in Dianas grove
Its said that Daedalus fleeing Minos kingdom
trusted himself to the sky on sweeping wings
taking this unusual passage to the frosty
North At last he floated down on Chalcis peak
Back on land he pledged Phoebus his wings
his oars for flightand built a lofty shrine
20 On its doors he carved Androgeos death
and the Athenians who paid an awful price
seven sons each year an urn holds the lots
185

Facing this the land of Crete soars from the sea
Heres Pasiphaes ruinous passion for a bull
their stealthy coupling and their son the hybrid
Minotaur a monument to awful lust
Heres his lair the labyrinth of no return
But its builder Daedalus took pity on
a princess love and solved the tangled turns
30 guiding Theseus blind footsteps with a thread
Icarus youd be here too if grief allowed
Twice your father tried to carve your fall in gold
twice his hands fell from his work Aeneas wanted
to scan every detail but Achates sent
ahead returned with Glaucus child Deiphobe
priestess of Diana and Apollo She said
This is no time to be gaping at the sights
Kill seven bulls whove never felt the yoke
and just as many sheep His men were quick
40 to carry out the sacred task Then the priestess
called the Trojans into her high temple
Theres a cliff at Cumae whose vast flank is cut
into a cave with openings to a hundred shafts
Through them rush the Sibyls answers hundredfold
As they reached the cave she cried We must consult
the oracle at once look the god is present
At the door her complexion changed her hair
sprang loose she began to pant her heart was full
of frenzy She seemed taller and her voice
50 was not a humans for Apollo was approaching
and she felt his breath Trojan Aeneas she cried
You hesitate to offer vows Yet only then
186

will the mighty jaws that shake this cavern open
wide and awe us Silence A chill shiver swept
the Trojans hardy bones Their king prayed from his heart
Phoebus you who always pitied Troys great pain
who directed Paris arrow to pierce Achilles
youve led my voyage through the many seas
that flow around the continentsto far
60 Massilian tribes to fields that fringe the Syrtes
At last weve come to Italys receding shores
Dont let Iliums fate still hound us All you gods
and goddesses if Troy and her great fame were once
an aggravation now with justice you may
spare the race of Pergamum Holy priestess
you who see the future let the Trojans live
in Latium I only claim land owed to me
by Fate with their straying stormtossed gods
Ill raise a shrine of solid marble to Phoebus
70 and Diana and choose feast days for Apollo
Once I rule Ill build a great shrine for you too
kind Sibyl Ill include the secret prophecies
you told my people and consecrate your priests
But dont entrust your oracles to leaves or theyll
end up muddled playthings spun by whirling
breezes Chant them yourself I beg He stopped
The Sibyl still could not accept Apollo
She spiraled through the cave trying to force
the great god from her mind But he wore her out
80 still more and forced the seer to his will
On their own the hundred huge shafts of the cave
swung open wafting out her answers Trojans
187

youve left behind the seas great risks at last
but graver ones remain on land The Dardans
will attain Lavinian land let go this worry
but theyll wish they hadnt I see brutal wars
and bloody torrents frothing in the Tiber
There too youll find a Simos a Xanthus and
Greek camps In Latium youll find a new Achilles
90 he too a goddesss son And worse theres Juno
everywhere A poor supplicant how many
towns and tribes of Italy youll beg for help
The cause of so much trouble for the Trojans
Again a foreign bride a foreign wedding
Dont give up at these misfortunes Be as brave
as Fortune lets you The first path to safety
will surprise you itll appear in a Greek city
The Sibyl sang these fearsome riddles
in her shrine wrapping truth in darkness
100 as her cave echoed round her as Apollo
flicked her reins and sank his spurs in deeper
When her seizure ended and her ravings stopped
the hero Aeneas spoke No aspect of these
labors is unknown to me Ive foreseen
them all and thought about each one of them I ask
one thing Its said this spots a doorway to Hells
ruler and the murky swamp of Acheron
Let me see my dear father face to face
teach me how open the sacred portal
110 He was the one my shoulders saved from flames
and a thousand hostile spears all around us
He shared my journey At my side he took on
188

all the oceans all the threats of sky and sea
a feeble man bearing a fate beyond old age
He even begged me to approach your doors
and seek you as a supplicant I pray
be kind pity a father and his son You can
Hecate granted you Avernus groves to rule
If Orpheus could summon his wifes shade
120 with his Thracian lyres melody
if Pollux shared his brothers death and often
took his place in Helland what of Theseus
and Hercules My blood too is that of Jove
He grasped the altar praying and the Sibyl spoke
Anchises Trojan son born of divine blood
its easy to descend into Avernus
Night and day the door of dusky Dis lies open
To trace your steps and see the light again
heres the toil and effort A few justly loved
130 by Jove whom blazing courage carried to the sky
succeededsons of gods Forest fills the center
the dark embrace of Cocytus surrounds it
But if this urge compels you if you must indulge
this folly twice crossing the Stygian swamp
twice seeing black Tartarus hear then
your first task A golden branch with golden
leaves and stubborn golden stems hides in the murky
foliage of Proserpinas sacred tree
concealed by forest and the valleys gloom None
140 may penetrate the hidden alcoves under earth
until theyve plucked its golden growth lovely
Proserpina ruled that it must be a gift
189

for her If one branch is plucked a new one
takes its place and grows gold leaves as well
Scour the deep woods Once youve spotted it
pluck it off by hand If youre the one fate calls
itll break off easily If not no force
no blade will help you tear it off Also
I have sad news A friends corpse lies along
150 the shore and pollutes the fleet with death
while you seek advice and loiter at my door
First take him to his restingplace and bury him
Then offer black cattlethe first expiation
This way youll see the Stygian groves at last
the lands barred to the living Her mouth snapped shut
Aeneas left the cave walked on He stared
sadly at the ground as he considered
this blind turn of events Loyal Achates
kept him company and shared his worries
160 They covered many topics as they talked
What friend did the Sibyl mean what body
needed burial And then they saw Misenus
on the sandy shore his life cut short unfairly
Aeolus son Misenus most skilled of men
to fire up hearts for battle with his bugles blare
Marked out by his spear and trumpet he used
to fight next to his friend great Hector When
victorious Achilles robbed Hector of life
this bravest of heroes joined Aeneas
170 as companion following no lesser leader
But when he seized his hollow horn to make the seas
resound challenging the gods in song the fool
190

jealous Triton grabbed him up if the tale
is true and drowned him in the rocky surf
They all raised loud laments around the body
pious Aeneas the most then carried out
the Sibyls orders In tears they heaped logs on
the pyre and strove to raise it to the sky
They entered ancient woods and wild lairs
180 Pine trees fell holmoaks rang to axes strikes
oaks and ash trees fissured as the axmen drove in
wedges They rolled huge rowans down the hills
Aeneas led the work and spurred the men
His tools were theirs But in his somber heart
he thought of what hed learned and gazed over
the farflung forest Just then by chance he prayed
I wish the golden branch would show itself
in this vast wood right nowsince what the Sibyl said
of you Misenus turned out all too true
190 At his words twin doves flew down from the sky
landing on the grassy sod before him
The great hero knew his mothers birds
and gladly prayed Be my guides if theres a path
and wing your way into the woods wherever
that lush branch casts shade on loamy soil
And you my goddess mother help me in my
hour of need He spoke and stopped to see
what signs the doves gave where they went
As they fed the birds flitted from spot to spot
200 always staying in his line of sight
When they reached Avernus jaws and reeking gorge
they quickly rose gliding through the crystal air
191

and perched right where hed hoped on the dappled tree
The golds shining aura shimmered through the branches
It looked like mistletoe in winters cold when
its green leaves ring around a fostertrees
smooth trunk the yellow flowers blooming This was
how the shining gold appeared growing
on the shadowed oak rustling in the breeze
210 At once Aeneas grabbed it He snapped it eagerly
as it held on and took it to the priestess shrine
On the shore the Trojans mourned Misenus
offering last rites for his thankless embers
They raised a massive pyre fragrant with pine
and planks of oak then wove dark foliage
along its sides and set up gloomy cypresses
in front His gleaming armor crowned the top
Some prepared hot water boiling it in cauldrons
They washed and anointed the cold corpse
220 and set the man they wept for on a bier groaning
giving him the purple robes owed to the dead
Others raised the massive litter an unhappy
duty and set a torch below eyes averted
for the rite A pile of gifts went up in flames
frankincense and foodstuff olive oil in bowls
When the blaze collapsed into gray cinders
they washed the thirsty ashes his remains with wine
Corynaeus laid the bones in a bronze urn
and walked around the men three times with sacred
230 waterthe dew of a fertile olive branch
sprinkling it to cleanse them saying the last words
Pious Aeneas built the tomb a giant barrow
192

topped off with Misenus armor oar and trumpet
below a looming bluff now called Misenus
after him The name will last through all the ages
Next he quickly carried out the Sibyls orders
There is a deep and yawning cave its mouth
a giant jagged gape A black lake and a forests
shadow shield it No bird can wing its way
240 across it with impunity so putrid is
the breath its black jaws pour out to the upper air
For this the Greeks called it Avernus birdless
The priestess set four steers with pitchblack hides
before the altar She poured wine on their heads
and plucked the tall bristles between their horns
to throw into the sacred flames as offerings
Next she called on Hecate who moves Heaven
and Hell They cut the steers throats and caught
warm blood in bowls Aeneas sword struck down
250 a black lamb for the Furies mother Night and her
sister Earth a barren cow for Proserpina
He lit night altars to the Stygian king
setting whole bulls on the flames pouring
fatty oil over the burning entrails
At the rising suns first rays the ground rumbled
and forest ridges shook As Hecate approached
dogs seemed to howl through the halflight
Get out get out unholy ones the Sibyl cried
Leave all the grove behind And you Aeneas
260 quickly grab your weapon from its sheath
Now you must be brave and resolute
Raving she flung herself into her open cave
193

Aeneas kept pace and not with timid steps
O gods who govern souls O silent shades Chaos
Phlegethon and mute expanses of the night
let it be right to tell what I have heard let me
show whats buried deep in earth and darkness
They went faded figures in the lonely night
through the lifeless empty realm of Dis
270 as if through a wood under a clouded moons
thin light when Jove has plunged the sky in shadow
and black night leaches color from the world
At the entrance in Orcus very jaws
Grief and vengeful Sorrow made their beds
and Pale Diseases sad Old Age and Fear
and illadvising Hunger and shameful Poverty
forms horrible to see and Death and Suffering
then Deaths brother Slumber and the Joys
of evil men Facing them were murderous War
280 and the Furies iron chambers and mad Discord
her serpent hair bound up with bloody ribbons
There a giant darkleafed elm spread out
its ancient branches They say false Dreams
live on it clinging under every leaf
Many other ghastly forms of freaks
were stabled by the doors Centaurs biform Scylla
Briareus hundred arms the beast of Lerna
hissing horribly Chimaera breathing fire
Gorgons Harpies and the ghost of threetrunked
290 Geryon Aeneas shook with sudden fear
He grabbed his sword and held its naked edge to them
194

If his wise guide hadnt chided him that these
were insubstantial wraiths and flitting images
hed have rushed to slash the shadows pointlessly
From here began the path to hellish Acherons
violent whirls of water It seethed and swirled
belching sand into the river Cocytus
Filthy Charon wearing stinking rags
ferried ghosts across the stream His lengthy
300 beard was matted stiff his eyes stared fixed
and fierce A dirty wrap was tied around his neck
He poled the boat himself tending to the sails
toting bodies in the dingy raft He was old
but it was the green and raw old age of gods
All the crowd came streaming to this shore
mothers men the lifeless bodies of brave
heroes boys and unwed girls sons placed
on the pyre before their parents eyes
as many as the forest leaves that fall
310 in autumns early chill as many as
the birds who flock to land from sea when winter
drives them south to sunny lands There
they stood pleading to be first to cross
stretching longing hands toward the farther bank
The surly boatman took now some now others
The rest he shoved far from the sandy shore
Aeneas was surprised and moved to see the tumult
He asked Why are they rushing to the stream
What do these souls want Why are some left behind
320 while others sweep black water with the oars
The ancient priestess answered in few words
195

Anchises son the gods true child you see
the sluggish depths of Cocytus and Styx
by which gods fear to swear false oaths All this
crowd you see lacks burialor any recourse
The ferryman is Charon his passengers have graves
He cant carry anyone across the awful
roaring waters till their bones find rest
They flit around these shores one hundred years
330 At last they board and reach the bank theyve craved
Anchises son stopped still and stood mulling over
many things He pitied these souls unfair fate
He saw Leucaspis and Orontes leader of
the Lycian fleet both sad without funerals
The south wind had submerged the men and ships
as they sailed on stormswept seas from Troy
Now the helmsman Palinurus passed by him
Lately on the course from Libya as he read
the stars hed toppled from the stern into deep sea
340 Aeneas barely making out his sad form
in the gloom cried out his name What god stole you
from us and threw you in the sea Tell me
Ive never found Apollo false but when
he spoke of you he lied he prophesied
that youd stay safe across the sea to Italy
Is this how he keeps his word But the helmsman
said Apollos cauldron didnt lie to you
my lord Anchises son No god drowned me at sea
The helm my posting violently swung from me
350 as I held it tight and planned our course I fell
and dragged it with me I swear by the harsh seas
196

I feared less for me than for your ship
Her tiller gone her helmsman overboard
would she founder in the rising waves
For three winter nights the fierce south wind drove me
through the endless sea On the fourth dawn
I could just sight Italy from a high waves
crest I was closing on the shore almost
safe but as I grabbed rough cliffholds weighed down
360 by wet clothes a cruel tribe set on me
with knives thinking me a prize the fools
Winds and waves now roll me by the shore
I beg you by the lovely light of sky the air
by your father and your hopes for young Ilus
save me from this hell since youve overcome it
and throw soil on my corpse if you reach Velia
Or if you have a way if your goddess mother
shows you one you couldnt ford this stream
and Styxs swamp without divine assistance
370 take my poor hand take me on board with you
so that at least in death Ill find a place of rest
So he begged but the priestess countered
Palinurus why this dread desire to see
the Stygian waters and the Furies cruel streams
to approach the bank unburied and uncalled
As if the gods fates could be bent by prayer
But take my words as comfort for your pain
moved by divine omens nearby folk
from cities far and wide will appease your shade
380 Theyll raise a tomb for you and pay due offerings
That spot will always be called Palinurus
His cares were lifted at these words his sorrow
197

banished for a while The name brought him joy
And so they went on heading for the river
But from his stream the boatman saw them coming
from the silent grove and turning to the bank
He was quick to shout out a rebuke
You two armed and making for my river
stop right there and tell me why youre here
390 This is a place of shadows of Sleep and sleepy Night
Living bodies may not ride my Stygian boat
I wasnt pleased to transport Hercules
over the lake nor Theseus and Pirithos
and they were sons of gods never defeated
One wanted to chain Tartaruss guarddog
He dragged him trembling from the kings own throne
The other planned to steal our queen from Diss bed
Apollos seer answered in few words
We have no such scheme you neednt be upset
400 Our weapons dont bring violence Your guard can scare
the bloodless shades with barks for all eternity
the bride can chastely stay inside her uncles home
Aeneas of Troy famed for piety and martial
skill visits his father in the depths of Hell
If this model of great piety means nothing
at least you know this branch She took it
from her robe and his swollen heart let go
its rage No more was said He marveled at
the sacred gift the fateful branch displayed
410 after so long and swung his dark stern to the shore
Expelling all the souls that sat along the transoms
he cleared the gangway Then he boarded huge
198

Aeneas in his stitchedskin boat It groaned
under the weight marshwater flooded in
At last he set them safe across the river man and
seer onto the slimy mud and graygreen reeds
There sprawled giant Cerberus in a cave
along the bank He snarled at them from all three throats
When the priestess saw his snaky hackles rise
420 she tossed him a gob of honey and drugged grain
to make him sleep Three starving throats sprang open
greedy to snatch the morsel Then his massive bulk
slumped to the ground spanning the whole cave
Now that the guard was sunk in sleep Aeneas entered
quick to leave the stream no man could ford again

At once he could hear voices the loud wails
and weeping souls of babies cheated of sweet life
At the start a black day tore them from their
mothers milk and buried them in bitter death
430 Next were those wrongly condemned to die
Jurors drawn by lot decided where theyd go
Minos was the magistrate He shook the urn
and called a council of the dead to judge the crimes
Next were the despondent suicides
Though innocent they threw their lives away
sick of the light of day How gladly now theyd welcome
pain and poverty just to breathe the air
But divine law forbids it The gloomy waves and
hateful swamp confine them and the nine coils of
199

440 the Styx Close by he was shown the Fields of Mourning

as theyre called They stretched in all directions
Here were those whom heartless love consumed
with cruel pining Secret paths and myrtle trees
concealed them and their passion lived past death
He saw Phaedra Procris and Eriphyle
sadly showing stabs her cruel son inflicted
Pasiphae Laodamia and Evadne
With them was Caeneus once transformed into a man
then given back her former shape by fate
450 In this great wood Phoenician Dido her wound
still fresh wandered with them When the Trojan
hero neared and saw her misty shape among the ghosts
as when one sees or thinks one sees a new moon
climbing through the clouds when the month is young
he spoke to her in tears with tender love
Unhappy Dido so the news I heard was true
Youre dead a suicide by the sword But
did I cause your death I call the stars and gods
to witness if the Underworld allows the truth
460 I left your shores against my will O Queen
The orders of the gods which force me now
to walk through shades and squalor in deep night
forced me those days too How could I think
Id cause you so much pain by my departure
Stop dont rush from my sight Who is it
you run from Fate gives us a final chance to speak
With these words he tried to soothe the raging soul
that looked at him so fiercely His tears fell
But Dido turned away her eyes fixed on the ground
470 her face just as unaltered by his speech
200

as hard flint or a rocky crag of marble
At last she broke away hatefilled and hurried
to the shaded forest where Sychaeus her first
husband shared her pain and matched her love
Aeneas was shaken by her unjust death His eyes
followed her with tears and pity as she left
He struggled on his given path And now they reached
the farthest fields set aside for heroes in war
Tydeus met them with Parthenopaeus
480 great in battle and the shade of pale Adrastus
Also Trojans who fell fighting lamented
to the skies He groaned to see the crowded ranks
Thersilochus Glaucus Medon Antenors
three sons Polyboetes priest of Ceres
and Idaeus with his chariot and armor
The souls thronged round him to the left and right
To see him was too little they wanted to linger
to walk with him and learn why he had come
But the Greek chiefs and Agamemnons army
490 shook in fear when they saw the heros weapons
gleaming in the gloom Some turned round to run
just as they once scuttled to their ships Others
raised a weak warcry that mocked their gaping jaws

And now he saw Deiphobus Priams son
his whole body mangled his face and both his hands
with cruel gashes ears ripped from his ruined head
his nose slashed to the nostrilsa shameful injury
201

Aeneas hardly knew the trembling shade that tried
to hide its ghastly wounds and questioned his old friend
500 Great warrior of Teucers noble blood
who chose to punish you so viciously Who took
such liberties On that final night I heard
you fell onto a heap of mingled corpses
exhausted from your massacre of Greeks
I raised your empty tomb on Rhoeteums shore
and loudly called your shade three times Your name
and armor mark the place but I never found you
friend to bury you before I left our country
Friend you left nothing undone said Priams son
510 You paid the honors due Deiphobuss ghost
My fate and Spartan Helens heinous crime threw me
in this hell she left me these souvenirs
You know we filled that final night with foolish
revelry You must recall it all too well
When the deadly horse pregnant with infantry
entered our citadel Helen faked a Bacchic
frenzy and launched the shrieking Trojan women
into dance Then she raised a giant torch
to signal to the Greeks from our acropolis
520 I was in my luckless marriagebed worn out
with worry lost in sleep A deep sweet rest
was pressing on me like the peace of death
My darling wife removed the weapons from our house
and stole the trusted sword under my head
She flung the entrance open and called in Menelaus
no doubt hoping this great favor to her lover
would erase the infamy of her old sins
Whats left to say He burst in with Ulysses
202

the father of all crime O gods pay back the Greeks
530 in kind if I ask for vengeance justly
But tell me now what brought you here alive
Did you steer off course as you were sailing
Is this some gods command What fate hounds you so
that youd approach this place of murk and misery
Meanwhile Aurora in her rosy chariot
had crossed the summit of the sky and perhaps
theyd have used up all their time in talk
but the Sibyl his companion warned him curtly
Night falls fast Aeneas We waste our hours weeping
540 Here the path splits into two On the right
the route leads past the walls of mighty Dis our way
to Elysium The left path sends the wicked
to their punishment in godless Tartarus
Deiphobus replied Dont rage at me great priestess
Ill return and take my place among the dead
Go on glory of our land Be luckier
than me So he spoke turning away
Aeneas stole a quick glance back To the left
under a cliff was a massive fortress ringed with
550 triple walls and a raging moat of fire
Phlegethon hurling thunderous rocks
In front a giant gate and adamantine pillars
No human force not even warring gods
could rip them out An iron tower reached the sky
There Tisiphone crouched wakefully her bloody cloak
hitched high She watched the entrance day and night
You could hear groans and savage lashstrokes
203

irons clanking chains being dragged Terrified
Aeneas stopped to listen to the clamor
560 Virgin what were their crimes What tortures are
inflicted here Why does this wailing fill the air
The seer began Famed leader of the Trojans
no good souls may cross this evil threshold
When Hecate assigned Avernus woods to me
she taught me all the ways gods punish men
Cretan Rhadamanthus rules these cruel realms
He hears and rebukes deceit making men
confess the secret crimes they relished when alive
the guilt they pointlessly delayed till deaths late hour
570 Vengeful Tisiphone carrying her whip
at once leaps down to flay the guilty She thrusts
her vicious snakes at them calling on her cruel
sisters Finally the awful gate swings open
with the screech of grating hinges Do you see
her awful lurking shape guarding the entrance
More savage still is whats inside massive Hydra
her fifty black mouths gaping Then Tartarus itself
plunges to a sheer abyss a fall to darkness
twice as far as when we gaze at high Olympus
580 The Titans are there an ancient race of Earth
struck down by lightning They grovel in the dregs of Hell
I also saw Aloeus twins giant bulks
who tried to tear down heaven with their hands
and dislodge Jupiter from his high realm
I saw Salmoneus paying a cruel price
for mimicking Joves lightning and Olympian thunder
He rode in triumph through Greek cities and
his home town Elis brandishing a torch taking
204

for himself the honor due the gods the fool
590 faking the impossiblestorms and lightning
with bronze cymbals and the beat of hooves
The mighty father flung his firebolt through
the heavy cloudshe didnt need the smoky light
of sputtering torchesand hurled him straight to Hell
Tityus was here fosterson of Earth
his body sprawling through nine acres A filthy
vulture digs into his deathless liver always
ripe for torture with its curving beak
foraging for dinner at home deep in
600 his guts The reborn organ gets no rest
Should I mention Lapiths Pirithos and
Ixion A black cliff looms over them
on the verge of falling Golden legs gleam on
their couches and a feast of royal opulence
is spread but the leader of the Furies sits
right there forbidding them to reach for food
always leaping up raising her torch and shrieking
All those who loathed their brothers during life
who beat their parents or caught clients in a web
610 of fraud or sat on gold theyd just acquired putting
no part aside for family the biggest group
or were murdered in adultery or fought
in civil wars or broke faith with their masters
locked up they wait for punishment Dont ask
what punishment Theres no one form or fate
Some heave along huge boulders or lie outspread
on wheelspokes Doomed Theseus will sit forever
in a chair and Phlegyas who suffers most
205

chides all of them and cries among the shades
620 Be warned learn justice do not scorn the gods
This one sold his country and let a tyrant
rule it This one made and remade laws for money
Incest drove one to his daughters bed
All dared monstrous crimessuccessfully
A hundred tongues and mouths an iron voice
wouldnt let me cover the varieties
of evil nor all the names for punishments
This said Phoebus aged priestess told him Come
return now to the road end the task you started
630 We must hurry I can see the ramparts built
by Cyclopian forges and the arching gateway
Our orders were to set the gift down here
They went along the dark path side by side
crossed the open ground and reached the doors
Aeneas entered first He sprinkled himself with fresh
water then set the branch at Proserpinas threshold
They were done the goddess gift delivered
The fields of joy were next the sweet green groves
held by the fortunate homes of the blessed
640 The fields were bathed in dazzling light by skies
wider than ours and a different sun and stars
Some exercised in grassy rings or fought
mock battles grappling on the golden sand
Others stamped their feet in dance singing songs
The Thracian seer was there in his trailing robe
He played his lyres seven strings in rhythm
plucking notes with fingers or an ivory pick
206

Teucers ancient race was there his handsome sons
greatsouled heroes born in better years Ilus
650 Assaracus and Troys founder Dardanus
Aeneas marveled at their phantom chariots
and armor the spears fixed in the earth the horses
freely grazing far and wide The mens love
of chariots and armor of feeding their sleek
stallions lasted after death He saw
others to the right and left feasting
in the meadows singing glad odes in groves
fragrant with laurel where the great stream Eridanus
surfaces to flow among the trees
660 Here were legions wounded fighting for their
country priests whod led pure lives pious
poets with songs worthy of Apollo
men who bettered life by new inventions
and those whose merit set them down in memory
All their brows were bound with snowwhite ribbons
As they thronged around the Sibyl spoke to them
Musaeus first he was in the center
of the crowd tallest by a head She asked
Tell me happy souls and you best among poets
670 what land what place holds Anchises Its for
his sake weve come fording mighty Erebus
The hero answered briefly No ones home
is set We live in shady groves or by
the riverbanks soft bends or meadows sweet
with streams But if this is what you want you must
climb this ridge Ill show you an easy path
He walked ahead pointing out the shining fields
below The other two descended from the heights
207

Deep in that lush valley Father Anchises
680 made a careful count of gathered souls
as they waited for the light above He happened
to be tallying his family his dear
grandsons fates and fortunes natures and great deeds
When he saw Aeneas coming to him through
the meadow he stretched out both arms eagerly
Tears ran down his face and he exclaimed
Youve come at last I knew your piety
would overcome the dangers of the trip Do I
see your face my child and hear that voice I know
690 I expected this would happen I counted
down the days My worrys been rewarded
Youve come so far by land and sea to visit me
dear son and youve suffered so much hardship
How I feared that youd be harmed in Libya
He answered Father your sad ghost visiting
so often made me cross this boundary
Our fleet waits on the Tuscan sea Let me clasp
your hand dont pull back from my embrace
Tears soaked Aeneas face Three times he tried
700 to wrap his arms around his fathers neck three times
his hands passed through the insubstantial shade as if
it were the merest breeze a fleeting dream
And now Aeneas saw at the valleys end
a sheltered wood with rustling branches and
the river Lethe flowing through this peaceful place
The souls of countless peoples flitted here
the way bees haunt a meadows manycolored flowers
208

in the still of summer circling round bright
lilies as the whole field buzzes with their hum
710 This sudden sight startled Aeneas He asked
for explanation What is that faroff river
Who are the many men who throng its banks
Anchises said These are the souls to whom
fate owes new bodies They drink from Lethes stream
it offers peace and long oblivion Ive yearned
so long to show and tell you of them face to
face this gathering of my family so that
youd be still happier at finding Italy
But father must we think that some souls pass from here
720 to life above taking up the weight of flesh
again Why this awful longing for the light
Ill tell you son Anchises said You wont remain
confused And he explained each thing in order
First the sky and land and liquid fields of sea
the silvery sphere of moon and Titan the sun
Spirit nurtures them within and Minds infused
throughout animating mass and mixing with it
From here comes the race of men and beasts the lives
of birds the monsters under Oceans marble surface
730 These seeds have a fiery vigor and their source
is heavenly But harmful matter slows them down
and theyre blunted by our bodies which must die
So men fear and want grieve and feel glad
Locked in this dark dungeon they cant perceive the sky
Poor things even when life leaves them on the day
of death not every sin or canker of the flesh
fully recedes Many habits harden
209

over time and in this way become ingrained
So they pay for former crimes by torment
740 exposed to hollow winds by crucifixion
washed clean of infection in a whirling flood
or cauterized by firewe all suffer our souls
cure Then were sent to wide Elysium
A few of us stay in this happy place
until long years have purged the final taint of matter
and times great wheel has come full circle only
ethers spirit the fire of pure air remains
When the rest have cycled through a thousand years
the god calls them in clusters to the river Lethe
750 These forgetful spirits hope for resurrection
into bodies They start to want to see the sky
Falling quiet Anchises drew his son and Sibyl
to the center of the bustling crowd
From a hill he studied the men marching by
and knew their faces in the long procession
Come he said Ill reveal the future glory
of our Trojan lineage and the Italians
who wait for us splendid souls wholl take our name
Ill teach you your destiny Do you see
760 the young man leaning on the headless spear
By lot hell be the next to reach the light
above his blood mingled with Italys
Silvius an Alban name your lastborn son
Lavinia your wife will bear him in a forest
when youre elderly a king to other kings
a father Through him our race will rule in Alba Longa
210

Next is famous Procas glory of the Trojan
race Then Capys Numitor and your namesake
Silvius Aeneas your match in piety
770 and weaponsif he can take up Albas throne
What young mensee the great strength that they show
the civic crowns of oak leaves on their heads
Theyll found Nomentum Gabi Fidena
theyll set Collatias fortress on the hills
Pometi Castrum Inu Bola and
Cora will be names now just nameless lands
Mars son Romulus will join his grandfather
on earth Trojan through his mother Ilia
Do you see his helmets double crests
780 His father honored him with his own emblem
Under his rule shining Rome will spread
her empire through the world her spirit to Olympus
and set a single wall around her seven hills
Shell be rich in sonslike towercrowned Cybele
riding in her chariot through Phrygian towns
happy in the gods she bore a hundred grandsons
in her arms all divine all heavendwellers
Now turn your eyes look at this race your Romans
Here is Caesar with all of Ilus children
790 wholl come under the skys great axis And here
the man you hear so often promised to you
Augustus Caesar born of gods wholl bring
a golden age to Latium where Saturn lived
and push his empire past the Garamants
and Indians to lands beyond our stars
beyond Suns yearly path where Atlas hoists the sky
turning the starstudded sphere on his shoulder
211

Even Caspian lands and the Black Sea dread his
approach they already fear the prophecies
800 The seven deltas of the Nile tremble in terror
Hercules himself did not cross so much land
although he shot the bronzehoofed deer brought peace
to Erymanthus woods and scared the Lerna with
his bow nor triumphant Bacchus using vines
to steer his team of tigers as he drives down Nysas
summit Will we hesitate to put our courage
to the test Does fear keep us from our home
in Italy Whos that far off distinct with his
olive crown and offerings I see the gray beard
810 of King Numa called from humble Cures
and its pauper fields to power Hell impose
the rule of law Next is Tullus who will
shatter the lands peace and push into armed
ranks slow men long since unused to triumph
The boaster Ancus follows him even now
too taken with the masses favor Do you wish
to see the Tarquin kings and the proud soul
of Brutus the avenger who won back the fasces
Hell be the first to hold a consuls power and
820 the cruel axes For lovely liberty hell kill
his own sons when they stir up revolution
unhappy man however later ages tell it
His love of country wonand his great greed for glory
Far off you see the Drusi and the Decii
Torquatus brutal axman and Camillus savior
of the standards That shining pair in matching armor
in concord now while darkness presses them
212

if they ever reach the light of life ah
the wars the slaughter theyll stir up The fatherinlaw
830 swoops down from his Alpine ramparts and
Monoecus heights while his sonin law masses
the Eastern enemy My sons dont warm to war
dont turn your sword against your countrys heart
You who trace your blood back to Olympus stop first
drop your weapon from your hand my kin
This ones fame comes from the Greeks he killed at Corinth
hell ride in victory to the lofty Capitol
That one will destroy Argos Agamemnons
Mycene and Perseus great Achilles
840 heir avenging Troy and Minervas looted
temple Whod omit great Cato or you Cossus
Or the Gracchi and two Scipios Libyas
ruin thunderbolts of war Fabricius
powerful though poor Serranus sowing furrows
You Fabii why hurry Maximus
youll be the only one to save our land by lagging
Others I believe will beat out bronze that seems
to breathe and chisel living faces out of marble
Theyll excel in pleading lawsuits and theyll trace
850 the heavens paths and chart the rising stars
You Roman remember your own arts to rule
the world with law impose your ways on peace
grant the conquered clemency and crush the proud in war
They were struck with awe Anchises added
See Claudius Marcellus marked by splendid spoils
Victorious he strides along the tallest there
This horseman will steady Roman power
213

in a time of chaos trample rebel Gaul and
Carthage and for the third time offer captured arms
860 to Romulus Aeneas saw a handsome young man
near Marcellus in bright armor but his face
showed little joy and his eyes were downcast
He asked Anchises Who is that who goes with him
A son A sons son from this noble stock
How his comrades cheer What a fine impression
But black night flaps around his head with her grim shadow
Then tears welled in Anchises eyes My child
dont ask about the great grief of your people
The fates will offer us the merest glimpse of him
870 they wont let him live long Would the Romans seem
too powerful to you O gods if he were ours
What mighty groans of men the Field of Mars
will send to our great city What a funeral
youll see Tiber as you pass his tombs fresh soil
No other Trojan boy will so exalt the hopes
of his Latin forefathers nor will the land
of Romulus ever boast his like again
his piety oldtime honor and unconquered
strength Hed have had no equal in a fight
880 no matter if he met the enemy on foot
or horse spurring on his stallions sweaty flanks
Unhappy boy if you can change your cruel fate
youll be a true Marcellus Fill my arms with lilies
Ill scatter these bright flowers for your soul
my kinjust poor offerings and an empty
rite So they passed through the whole region
in the misty air and surveyed it all
Anchises led his son through every sight
214

and fired his spirit with a love of future glory
890 Then he told him of the wars hed have to fight
and spoke of the Laurentians and Latinus
town the hardships to avoid those to endure
There are twin Gates of Sleep One they say is made
of horn and lets true visions pass through easily
The other gleams with complex work in ivory
but through it shades send lying visions to the light
Anchises and the Sibyl brought Aeneas
to this gate and sent him through He hurried
to the ships and joined his crew They sailed
900 along the coastline to Caietas harbor
and cast anchor The sterns rested on the shore

215

BOOK 7


Caieta once Aeneas nurse you died here too
The city named for you now has eternal fame
This honor marks your bones and resting place
in great Hesperiaif that is any glory
After her burial rites when the gravemound had been
raised pious Aeneas waited for calm seas
then made his way from port under full sail
The breezes blew past sundown and the shining moon
lit up their path the ocean gleamed with shivery light
10 First they grazed the shores of Circe the Suns
wealthy daughter Around her dangerous groves
resounded with her singing In her lofty halls
she kindled cedar to dispel the dark and wove
a whirring shuttle through her looms fine warp
From here they faintly heard the angry growls
of lions yanking at their chains and roaring late at night
and bristly boars and bears raging in pens and huge
howling shapes of wolveshuman once but
altered from their form by the cruel goddesss
20 magic herbs They wore the face and fur of beasts
To spare the pious Trojans from the horrors
of this port and hateful shore Neptune
216

filled their sails with helping winds and pushed
their ships to safety past the foaming shoals

The sea began to blush with sun and saffron Dawn
high in her rosy chariot shone bright
Suddenly the winds died down and every gust
was still The oars pulled slowly in the marble sea
Then Aeneas on his ship saw a lengthy
30 stretch of woodland At that spot the lovely Tiber
yellow with thick sand and churning eddies
burst into the sea All around the varied
birds for whom the banks and stream were home
caressed the sky with song and flew among the trees
He told his crew to point the prows to land
Happily they sailed into the shaded stream
Come Erato Ill unfold the kings the times
the state of ancient Latium when foreign troops
first landed on Italian shores Ill call
40 to memory the incidents that started war
Goddess guide your poet Ill tell of brutal clashes
battle lines courage that sent kings to death
Etruscan warriors and all of Italy
in arms A greater series of events begins
a greater task for me
Elderly King Latinus
ruled these fields and quiet cities in long peace
They say that Faunus fathered him on Marica
a Laurentian nymph Faunus father Picus
217

traced his blood to Saturn founder of the race
50 By the gods decree Latinus had no sons
one was lost to him in childhood A single
daughter tended that great housenow of age
and ready for a husband Many from wide
Latium and Italy were wooing her
Turnus was the handsomest of all and
of noble ancestry The royal queen was keen
to make him soninlaw her love for him was striking
But sacred omens blocked this with a string of horrors
A laurel tree with holy leaves stood in the royal
60 homes inner court revered for many years
They say father Latinus found this tree
when he built the citadel He made it sacred
to Apollo and named his folk Laurentians
Now a swarm of bees amazing occupied
its crown sailing through the clear air
with a mighty buzz They wove their feet and formed
an instant beehive hanging from a leafy branch
At once the seer pronounced I see a foreign man
arriving with an armyhis path his goal
70 are like the bees he plans to take our heights
Then when chaste Lavinia lit the altar
with a sacred torch standing by her father
they saw her long hair catch on firehorrible
Her headdress crackled as flames scorched it
the tiara bright with many gems blazed up
She herself engulfed in smoke and orange
light scattered sparks through all the house
This was felt to be miraculous and awful
seers foresaw that shed be famed in life
218

80 and legend but bring great conflict to her people

The king worried by these omens visited
the oracle of Faunus his prophetic father
in great Albuneas grove which echoes
with a sacred spring the air is foul
and dark Here the Italians and all
Oenotria seek guidance when in doubt Once a
seer has given gifts he lies in the silent night
on pelts of sheep hes killed waiting for dreams
and sees an eerie host of phantoms flit around
90 with varied voices He has the right to speak
with gods he talks to Acheron in deep Avernus
Here Latinus likewise seeking answers
sacrificed a hundred woolly sheep
He spread their pelts and lay on them to rest
A sudden voice spoke out from the deep grove
Dont wed your daughter to the Latins son
dont trust the marriage thats already planned
Foreigners will come to be your sonsinlaw
Theyll raise our name up to the stars by blood
100 Their sons will see the world under their feet
Theyll rule as far as both the seas seen by the circling
sun Latinus didnt hide what Faunus said
the warning given in the silent night
When the men from Troy tied fast their fleet
to the rivers grassy bank flitting Rumor
had already spread it through Italian towns
Aeneas handsome Ilus and the leading princes
sprawled under a trees high branches to prepare
219

their meal They set flatbreads on the grass
110 as plates for food so Jupiter himself advised
and added woodland fruits to these spelt disks
By chance when everything was eaten hunger
made them gnaw the thin round crusts and break
with daring hands and mouths the disks of fateful
bread quartered sections one and all
See we eat our tables too said Ilus
only that a joke But this comment
marked the end of hardship Stunned Aeneas
seized on Ilus words and hushed his son
120 He spoke at once I greet you country owed to me
by fate and you the faithful gods of Trojan hearths
This is our home your native land My father
I remember left me with this fateful secret
When you come to unknown shores my son
and hunger makes you eat your tables then
despite exhaustion know youre home Set your buildings
here first and heap ramparts around them
This was that same hunger this was the last
trial we had to face an end to exile
130 At suns first light lets happily explore
this land and learn who lives in it and where
theyve set their towns Well branch out from the port
Now honor Jove with offerings pray to Father
Anchises and refresh the altars wine
He wound a leafy sprig around his head
calling on the local guardian spirit Earth
the first of gods nymphs and unknown streams
then Night its rising constellations Idas Jove
220

and the Phrygian Mother all in order
140 then his parents one in heaven one in Hades
The mighty Father thundered three times loudly
in the clear sky and flourished in his hand
a cloud that blazed with golden rays from high above
At once rumor swept the Trojan ranks
the time had come to build the fated walls
Quickly they renewed the feast setting up
and garlanding the wine glad at the great omen
At the start of day when Titans torch lit up
the land they scattered to spy out the towns
150 the coast and country Here was Numicus lake
here the river Tiber here lived strong Latins
Aeneas picked a hundred envoys of all ranks
and sent them to Latinus lordly home
decked with branches from Athenas olive tree
and taking presents for the king to ask for peace
No delay they rushed off at a rapid pace
Meanwhile he traced future walls with shallow trenches
on the shore building his first town circling
it with parapets and ramparts like a camp
160 When the envoys came they saw the Latins towers
and high homes and passed under the city gate
Outside the walls boys and young men in their prime
trained horses in the dust tamed teams for chariots
pulled bows taut or hurled vibrating lances
challenging each other to boxing or a race
One rode ahead to tell the aged king imposing
men in foreign clothes had come to Latium
Latinus had them called inside the palace
221

and took his seat on his ancestral throne
170 On the city peak Laurentian Picus palace

rose up huge and hallowed on a hundred columns
a site eerie with woods and ancient rituals
Auspicious kings received their scepters and the rods
of office here Their senatehouse and sacred feasts
were here and here at lengthy tables the elders
sat to eat after theyd sacrificed a ram
Statues of the ancestors stood in a row
inside the vestibule hewn of ancient cedar
Italus the vinegrower Sabinus
180 with his curving scythe ancient Saturn
and the bust of twofaced Janus other early
kings and those wounded fighting for their country
Many weapons too hung on the sacred doorposts
captured chariots and curving axblades crests of
helmets giant bolts from city gates spears and
shields bronze prows torn from ships Picus himself
the horsetamer sat there with an augurs staff
his tunic edged in purple a sacred shield
in his left hand His lover Circe lost to lust
190 used her golden wand and drugs to change him
to a bird and sprinkled colors on his wings
In this holy temple on his ancestral throne
Latinus called the Teucrians inside
When they came he said to them serenely
Speak Dardanians We know your city
and your race wed heard that you were sailing here
Why What cause what need carried your ships
222

to Italy through spans of dark blue sea
Perhaps you lost your way or storms blew you
200 off coursesailors often meet with such bad luck
Youve traveled up our stream you dock at our harbor
Dont reject our welcome The Latins are the race
of Saturn no chains or laws compel us to be just
only free willwe keep our old gods ways
I recall the story dims with passing years
how old Auruncans claimed that Dardanus born
in these fields later left for Phrygian Idas
towns and Thracian Samosnow its Samothrace
He sailed from here his Tuscan home of Corythus
210 These days his throne is in the starry skys gold
court His altars add to the gods numbers
Ilioneus answered him My king
distinguished son of Faunus no dark storms
or torrents forced us to your land nor did
stars and coastlines lead us off our course
We came on purpose to this city willingly
driven from our kingdomonce the greatest
the sun saw as he came from high Olympus
Our race goes back to Jupiter we men
220 rejoice in this Our king has Joves great blood
Aeneas of Troy who sent us to your shores
The fierce storm the vicious Greeks unleashed on Idas
fields how Fortune made the worlds of Asia
and Europe clash in warthis everyone has heard
even those who hold the farthest lands cut off
by Oceans tides even those beyond the zone
of scorching sun the middle of the earths five tracts
223

We sailed from that cataclysm across many
seas We beg a small home for our native gods
230 a harmless stretch of shore with air and water
We wont disgrace your kingdom Your fame and our
gratitude for such a gift will never fade
Italy will not regret she welcomed Trojans
I swear this on Aeneas life and strong right hand
by which pacts were made and battles fought
many tribes and nations sought us for themselves
and hoped to make us allies Dont scorn us if we come
with olive sprigs and words of supplication
The gods fate made us seek your land Dardanus
240 began here and here Dardanians return
Apollo sends us urgent orders Come back
to Tuscan Tiber and Numicus sacred pools
Our leader also brings small tokens of our former
glory relics saved from burning Troy With this
gold cup Anchises poured libations at the altar
and this was Priams finery when he judged
the nations a sacred scepter and a diadem
and robes that Trojan women toiled to weave
Latinus fixed his gaze upon the ground
250 His face was still but his eyes moved in thought
The clothing stitched in purple didnt move him
nor did Priams scepter His daughters marriage
was a far greater concern He reflected
on the oracle of ancient Faunus
Was this the man foretold by fate whod come
from foreign lands to be his soninlaw to share
his power equally Would this race excel
in bravery and overcome the world by force
224

He spoke at last with joy May the gods support
260 our plan and their prophecy Youll get your wish
Trojan I dont spurn your gifts While I rule
you wont lack for fertile land or miss Troys wealth
Just let Aeneas come himself if he so much
wants to be my guestfriend and my ally
he shouldnt fear kindly faces My condition
for this pact will be to clasp his hand in mine
You then take this message to your king
I have a daughter but my fathers shrine
and many omens warn me not to marry her
270 to one of us Its said my soninlaw will come
from overseas to Latium that our blood
will lift our name up to the stars I think
the fates demand your kingand if Im right
Im ready Latinus picked out horses from his
stables whose high stalls held three hundred He sent them
to the Trojans right away stallions
with saddlecloths of purple thread Golden
neckchains dangled from their chests their coverings
were gold and their teeth champed on gold bridles
280 He sent a chariot for absent Aeneas
and a horseteam of celestial stock their nostrils
snorting fire They came from crossbreeds bred by clever
Circe whod mated stallions stolen from her father
with mortal mares Aeneas men returned on them
with Latinus gifts and words and news of peace
Cruel Juno was just coming back from Argos
Inachus town in her airborne chariot
Far off from the skies of Sicily she saw
225

glad Aeneas and the Trojan fleet She saw
290 their houses rising sailors trusting to the land
the ships unmanned Stopping short pierced with pain
she shook her head and poured out heartfelt words
Oh no That hated race those Phrygian fates opposed
to mine Why didnt they perish on Sigeums fields
Why wont these losers lose Why didnt they burn
in burning Troy So theyve found a way
through war and conflagration Is my power spent
or my loathing satisfied These fugitives
I hated them and dared to hunt them through the waves
300 I fought these exiles across every ocean
The strength of sea and sky was used up on these men
What use was Scylla or the Syrtes or awful
Charybdis Now the Trojans settle by the longedfor
Tiber safe from seaand me Mars could
kill off all the giant Lapiths the gods father
gave up ancient Calydon to soothe
Dianas rage undeserving victims both
But I Joves mighty wife who dared everything
I could who turned to every tactic Im losing
310 to Aeneas If my powers arent enough
why not stoop to begging anyone If I
cant move the gods above then Ill move Acheron
Granted I cant keep him from his Latin kingdom
I cant change Lavinias destined marriage
But I can delay crucial events I can
destroy their nations Let soninlaw and father
join the price will be their people My girl
your dowry will be blood Rutulian and Latin
Bellona waits to be your bridesmaid Hecuba
226

320 wont be the only woman to give birth

to wedding flames Venus son will be the same
a second Paris a fatal torch for this new Troy
Shes done The dreadful goddess makes for land
She rousts the griefbringer Allecto from the Furies
lair in Hells dark murk she who relishes
grim wars and rage and treachery and evil crimes
Even her father Pluto and her hellish sisters
hate this monsterso many are her awful forms
and faces so many black snakes swarm on her
330 Juno goads her with these words Virgin
born of Night take on this task a favor just for
me Save my name and honor from disgrace
and ruin Dont allow Aeneas men to sway
Latinus with a marriage and seize Italy
You cause loving brothers to seize swords you wreck
families with feuds and visit whips and death
on homes You have a thousand names and ways of harm
Look into your box of tricks undo the pact
of peace and sow the crimes of war Let men
340 want swords seek them seize them instantly
Allecto steeped in serpent venom swooped at once
to the Laurentian rulers halls in Latium
and stalked Amatas silent door The queen
was seething with a womans angst and anger
Trojans had arrivedwas Turnus marriage safe
Now Allecto flung a snake from her black hair
It pierced Amata then plunged deep into her heart
to derange her into ruining her own home
227

With viperish breath it slid between her clothing and
350 smooth breasts too subtle to be felt in her mad state
The giant snake became a golden chain
around her throat then melded with her headband
Unobserved it wove into her hair and slunk
across her frame At first while the poison just
attacked her senses winding fire round her bones
before she felt the full flame in her heart
she still spoke gently like a mother shedding
tears for her daughter and the Phrygian wedding
Will you give Lavinia to these Trojan exiles
360 Dont you pity her or yourself her father
Or me Whom that lying pirate will abandon
at first breeze departing with his stolen bride
This is how that Trojan shepherd came to Sparta
and stole Ledas daughter Helen off to Troy
What about your oath your old love for your people
the pledge you gave so often to my nephew Turnus
If her husband must be foreign to the Latins
and father Faunus orders bind you I say
every land is outside if our kingdom doesnt
370 rule it thats what the gods meant Turnus too
if you trace his peoples origin is from
Acrisius and Inachus a Mycenean
But when she saw that he opposed her and
her words were wasted and when the Furys poison
penetrated to her bones pervading her
then poor Amata goaded by the monster
rampaged in a shameless frenzy through the city
Like a spinning top that whirls under the whip
228

when little boys intent on play lash it round
380 an empty yard in circles the childish band
is captivated by its curving path
and wonders at the spinning boxwood toy
given life by blows just so Amata whirled
across the city and its warlike people
She faked a Bacchic trance and flew into the forest
Committing worse crimes as her madness
grew she hid her daughter in the leafy hills
to rob the Trojans of their torchlit wedding
shrieking Bacchus only you deserve her
390 She holds the pinetopped stalk for you she honors
you in dance for you she tends long hair
Rumor flew Right away the same strong urge
to find new homes drove all the raving mothers
They left home wearing fawnskins their heads bared
to wind or filled the air with warbling howls
holding vinebranches as spears The queen herself
stood in the center with a burning torch fevered
singing wedding hymns for Turnus and her daughter
her bloodshot eyes darting around She shouted
400 fiercely Latin mothers hear me all of you
if your pious hearts still care for sad Amata
if you feel anguish for a mothers rights
untie your hair and join my Bacchic revelry
With Bacchus goads Allecto whirled the mad queen
everywhere through the woods and dens of beasts
Once she saw shed honed Amatas fury well
and ruined Latinus plans and family
at once her dark wings took the awful goddess
229

to daring Turnus town They say that Dana
410 built it with Greek settlers when the swift South Wind
carried her there In old times it was called
Ardea and the names still famous but her peak
is past Here Turnus was sleeping soundly
under his high roof in dark of night
Allecto shed her fierce face and Furys body
taking on the look of an old woman
She lined her ugly brow with wrinkles added
headbands and white hair and wove in olive sprigs
becoming ancient Calybe priestess of Juno
420 She stood in front of him and said Turnus
will you let so much effort go to waste
and yield your scepter to the Dardan settlers
The king denies you marriage and the dowry won
by blood A foreign heir is chosen for the throne
Go then fool face thankless danger mow down
Tuscan soldiers keep the Latins safe
Almighty Juno ordered me to say this to you
as you rested in the calm of night Get up
gladly arm your men and march them out
430 to battle from the gates Set afire the Phrygian
chiefs and painted ships camped by our lovely stream
The gods great power calls for it If King Latinus
wont perform the wedding that he swore to let him
pay the price and learn what Turnus is in war
Scoffing at the priestess the young man said
The news that ships have sailed the Tibers stream
has not escaped my ears as you think
dont exaggerate the danger Nor has Juno
230

lost her love for me But as for you old age
440 and cobwebs have the better of you auntie
They cause you false concern tricking a seer
with silly fears and the fights of kings Your jobs
to guard the statues and the temples of the gods
Men will manage war and peace This is their work
Hearing this Allecto blazed up in a rage
and even as he spoke a sudden seizure took him
His eyes bulged in terror so many serpents hissed
around the awful form he saw He struggled to say
more but she turned wild burning eyes on him
450 and shoved him back Two snakes rose from her hair
She cracked her whip and said from rabid lips
Look Here I am bested by old age
and cobwebs tricked by silly fears and the fights
of kings Ive come from my deadly sisters home
and in my hand I bring you war and death
She hurled a firebrand at the man Smoking
with dark light it sank deep into his chest
A dreadful fear cut off his drowsiness at once
Sweat poured down and soaked him to the bone
460 Crazed he roared for weapons looked for them in bed
and in the house Battlefrenzy boiled in him
and lust for war but anger mostlike a seething
cauldron sitting over flaming twigs they crackle
and the liquid dances with the heat then the froth
rises and the boiling water bubbles over
and spills out thick vapor rises in the air
The peace was ruined Turnus told his chiefs to march
on King Latinus they should arm themselves
231

save Italy expel the enemy he could
470 handle both the Trojans and the Latins
He called the gods as witness to his vows
The Rutulians urged each other on
Turnus handsome youth and strength moved some
some his royal blood some his fame in fighting
While Turnus filled Rutulian hearts with courage
Allectos Stygian wings propelled her to the Trojans
with a new idea She checked the riverbank
and saw bright Ilus flushing game into his snares
The Fury cast a sudden frenzy on his dogs
480 She daubed the wellknown scent of deer onto their snouts
so theyd be hot to hunt This was the first
cause of conflict this roused country folk for war
There was a gorgeous stag with giant antlers
which Tyrrhus and his sons had taken from
its mothers teats and rearedTyrrhus keeper
of the royal herds and the kings wide fields
Silvia their sister groomed this docile deer
with love She twined soft garlands around his antlers
combed his coat and washed him in the clear springs
490 He let her pat him and ate from the masters table
Hed wander through the forest and willingly return
however late at night to the door he knew
This stag was far from home following the river
down the grassy banks where the heat was less
Ilus frothing dogs on the chase surprised him
Ascanius himself on fire to win high praise
aimed an arrow from his curving bow Some god
firmed his wobbling hand and the shaft
232

flew hissing through the deers flank and belly
500 He fled wounded to the safety of his home
and made it to his stall moaning bloody
filling the house with cries as if begging for help
Sylvias the first to beat her arms in grief
She calls her hardy countrymen to help
Theyre there suddenly dread Allecto still hid
in those silent woods one with a charred stake
one a heavy knotted club What each man gropes for
his rage makes a weapon Tyrrhus by chance
was splitting oaks in four pounding in the wedges
510 He calls his troops and grabs his ax breathing fury
The cruel goddess sees her chance for sabotage
She rushes from her lookout to the stable roof
and sounds the shepherds signal from on high
Her bugle blares a hellish sound At once
the deep woods shudder echoing the sound
Dianas distant lake hears it and Nars river
white with sulfur and Velinus springs
Scared mothers press their children to their breast
Rough farmers quick to answer seize their swords
520 and run from everywhere toward the frightful
sound The Trojans likewise break up camp
pouring out to bring Ascanius support
Battle lines are drawn This is not some rustic
brawl with heavy clubs and firecharred stakes
They fight with twoedged swords a black crop
of iron bristles far and wide Bronze armor
flashes in the sun its light reflected by
the cloudslike wavecrests whitening when the wind
233

picks up the ocean rises slowly the swells build
530 at last waves tower from the seabed to the sky
Now a whistling arrow drops a young man
out in frontAlmo Tyrrhus oldest son
The wound lodges in his throat blood wells up
to choke his breath and bubbling tries at speech
Many corpses fall around him old Galaesus
too as he comes up to plead for peace most just
of men richest in Italian pastures five flocks
of bleating sheep five herds of cows grazed on
his grounds a hundred plowshares tilled his land
540 With both sides matched the battle rages on the plain

So Allectoher promise fulfilled the war
now steeped in blood and men already killed
leaves Italy and whirls airborne to Juno
She reports in the proud tone of a victor
See my acts discord and the grief of war
Now let them be friends or join in treaties
Ive splashed the Trojans with Italian blood
Ill add this too if you say you want it
Ill spread the war to nearby towns with rumors
550 and fire their souls with insane lust for war
so theyll run to help from all around Ill sow
the fields with swords But Juno says Enough
of terror and deceit The causes of the war
are set They fight hand to hand fresh blood wets
the weapons chance provided Let Venus peerless son
and King Latinus celebrate such wedding rites
The lord of high Olympus does not want you
wandering at will through the breezes of the sky
234

Leave this place If theres further need
560 for action Ill take care of it myself
Allecto raises wings that hiss with snakes
and leaves the heavens for her home in Cocytus
In central Italy at the foot of mountains
theres a famous place spoken of by many
the valley of Amsanctus All around dark forest
rings it with dense leaves At the center
a loud torrent spins and tumbles boulders
Theres an eerie cave with holes for cruel Diss
breath to rise from a massive craters reeking
570 jaws Acheron erupts Here the Fury
hides her hated power relieving earth and sky
Meanwhile Saturns daughter adds her final flourish
to the war All the shepherds from the front
rush into town bringing back the dead boy
Almo and Galaesus with his mangled face
They implore the gods and call upon Latinus
Hearing cries of Murder in the heated crowd
Turnus feeds their fear Trojans are called to rule
our blood will mix with Phrygian Ill be banished
580 Those whose mothers gamboled in a Bacchic trance
among the pathless groves drawn by Amatas name
come together from all sides and call for battle
Through some malign influence now everyone
demands wars horrorsagainst omens against fate
They crowd and push around Latinus house
He stands like a rock steadfast against the sea
when crashing breakers come its way a mass
that doesnt move as waves smash all around it
235

The cliffs and foamy reefs roar uselessly
590 seaweed slams its side and slurps back out to sea
But the king cant stop the reckless plan
it goes as savage Juno wills it even though
he calls so often on the gods and empty breezes
Fate has broken us a storm sweeps us away
he cries My poor people youll pay the price
for blood you spill unjustly Turnus your crime
will reap harsh punishment youll beg the gods
too late Now I retirerobbed of a good
death in my old age He fences himself
600 in his house and drops the reins of state
There was a custom in Italian Latium
which Alban towns have since held sacred Great Rome
observes it when shes roused to fight and wreak
wars sorrows on the Getae or Hyrcani
or the Arabs to march eastward to India
and claim our standards from the Parthians
There are twin Gates of War by name feared
and revered in the cult of cruel Mars
A hundred brazen bolts and irons eternal strength
610 bind them Their watchman Janus never leaves his post
When the elders have resolved on war the consul
marked out by his Gabine belt and Quirine toga
unlocks the creaking gates and calls for war
The men muster bronze horns blare with hoarse
assent This is the custom that Latinus
should have observed in raising war against
Aeneas men to open the grim gates
But the father of his people will not touch them
236

Rejecting that foul task he hides himself in shadows
620 So Juno herself queen of gods glides down
and strikes the sluggish portal with her hand
The hinges turn the iron Gates of War burst open
Italy so calm and steadfast once is blazing
Some leave on foot across the fields some wildly stir up
dust on rearing stallions All want weapons
Men rub down their shields and spears with grease
polish them and whet axes on grindstones Theyre glad
to hoist the standards to hear the trumpets blast
Five great cities set up anvils to forge arms
630 strong Atina and proud Tibur Ardea
Crustumerium and towered Antemnae
They hammer hollow helmets and bend willowstalks
for shields Some forge breastplates out of bronze
and shining greaves from pliant silver The honor due to
plow and sickle all their love of farminggone
They recast their fathers swords The trumpets give
the sign the watchwords shared In a rush one grabs
a helmet from his house another drives his trembling
horses to the yoke grabbing his shield and
640 golden threeplied chain mail his trusty sword
O Muses open Helicons gates of song for me
Which kings were roused to war Which chiefs and armies
filled the fields What men were raised on Italys
rich soil back then what weapons fed her fire
You remember goddesses and you can tell it
Only the faintest breath of legend wafts to us
The first to enter war is harsh Mezentius
237

from Tuscan shores a despiser of the gods
and his troops Lausus his son is near breaker
650 of horses hunter of beasts No man is more
handsome except Laurentian Turnus Lausus
brings a thousand soldiers with him from Caere
but in vain He deserves more than his fathers
orders and a father not Mezentius
Next Aventinus handsome son of handsome
Hercules parades his palmdecked chariot
and winning team His shield sports his fathers emblem
Hydra circled by a hundred snakes The priestess
Rhea bore him secretly into the realm
660 of light within the woods of Aventine
She slept with the god Herculeshed just
murdered Geryon and reached Laurentian fields
where he washed his Spanish cows in Tuscan waters
His men bring spears and savage pikes to war
They fight with tapered swords and Samnite bayonets
A giant cape sweeps round their leader a matted
lionskin that once was Herculess cloak
The awful mane and ivory teeth rest on his head
Like this a horrid sight he walks into the palace
670 Next twin brothers from the town of Tibur

named for Tiburtus their other brother
Catillus and keen Coras men of Argive origin
They rush to the front through a sea of weapons
like two cloudborn Centaurs hurtling down
a mountain peak leaving Homole and snowy
Othrys at a breakneck pace the huge forest
238

yields to them branches buckle and snap loudly
Praenestes founder Caeculus is there as well
Every age has thought him born to Vulcan
680 in a herd of cows a king discovered
at the hearth He comes with a rustic legion
drawn from far and wide men from high Praeneste
the fields of Junos Gabi cold Anio and
Hernican crags dewy with streams men you nourish
rich Anagnia and you too Amasenus
Not all have weapons clanging shields or chariots
Most sling pellets of black lead others hold two
spears in their hands On their heads they wear
gray wolfskin caps Their custom is to march
690 with bare left feet rawhide boots cover the right
Messapus the horsebreaker son of Neptune
protected by the gods from death by sword or fire
at once calls to arms his soldiers so long idle
his troops unused to war and grips his sword again
Theyre from Fescennia and Aequi Falisci
Soractes heights Flavinias fields Ciminus
mountain lake and Capenas woods
They march in ranks and hymn their king
700 like snowy swans among the drifting clouds
coming back from feeding when they call
in rhythm from long throats the river Cayster
and its Asian marshlands echo far and wide
No one would think armored ranks of a huge force
were mingling here rather that an airy cloud
of raucous birds was blown from open seas to shore
239

Heres Clausus of ancient Sabine blood He brings
a great armyhimself a match for it His tribe
of Claudians has now fanned out through Latium
ever since the Sabines joined with Rome With him
710 a huge corps from Amiternum old Quirites
a band from Eretum soldiers from Mutuscas
groves Nomentum and Velinas fields
Tetricas rough crags Mount Severus
Casperia Foruli and the stream Himella
men who drink the Tiber or the Fabaris
men from freezing Nursia the Ortine ranks
the Latins and men watered by unlucky
Allia as many as the waves that cross
the Libyan sea when harsh Orion dips in winter
720 waters as dense as cornears parched by eastern sun
on Hermus plains or the tawny fields of Lycia
Shields clang Earth trembles at the tramp of feet
Halaesus Agamemnons son hater of Troy
yokes horses to his chariot He sweeps along
a thousand fierce tribes for Turnus men who plow
Massicas vinerich soil men sent by Auruncan
elders from their hills those from Cales and
Sidicinums plain men from the banks of
shallow Volturnus rough types from Saticula
730 and a throng of Oscans carrying smooth spears
that come with leather throwingstraps They battle
hand to hand with sabers and hold lefthanded shields
Oebalus my poem wont pass over you
They say that Telon sired you with the nymph Sebethis
240

late in life when he ruled the Teleboeans
in Capreae His fathers holdings didnt sate
the son Now he lords it over broader land
the Sarrastian tribes plains watered by the Sarnus
Rufrae Batulum the fields of Celemna
740 and men within the walls of applerich Abella
They throw boomerangs like German tribes
and strip the bark of corktrees for the helmets
on their heads Their bronze weapons shimmer
Ufens you were sent to war from hilly Nersae
You have great fame for luck in battle Your men
are unkempt Aequiculans who feed themselves
by hunting in the forests Their soil is hard
They work the earth while armed and love to seize
new spoils and to live off what they steal
750 Next priest Umbro of the Marruvi

bravest of men sent by King Archippus
his helmet decked with fronds of fertile olive
He has the skill to sprinkle sleep on venombreathing
snakes and vipers by his spells and touch
With his art he charms their anger heals their bites
But he cant cure a wound from Trojan iron
his mesmerizing chants the herbs he picked
on Marsian hills will not help his wounds
Umbro how Angitias forest and Fucinus
760 glassy waters and clear lakes will weep for you
Virbius goes to war as well Hippolytuss
handsome son sent by his mother Aricia
241

He grew up in Egerias grove near the
marshy shores and laden altars of kindly
Diana They say his crafty stepmother murdered
Hippolytus who paid his fathers curse in blood
torn to pieces by his bolting horses Yet he
was restored to starry skies and breezes reborn
through the Healers herbs and Dianas love
770 Then the mighty Father outraged that a human
should rise from Hells shades to the light of life
plunged the finder of this healing art
into Styxs waters with his lightning bolt
But kind Diana hid Hippolytus and sent
him to the forest of the nymph Egeria
so he could live a humble life in the Italian
woods his name changed to Virbius Horses
are forbidden from her temple and her sacred
groves since they broke both man and chariot
780 in their terror at the monster from the sea
On the plains his son trains highstrung horses as his
father did and drives a chariot to war
Turnus the most handsome gallops back and forth
before the line armed and tallest by a head
His helmet sports a triple plume The Chimaeras
on its crown her jaws breathe Etnas fire
The more the fight flows raw with blood
the more she roars darkflamed and feral
His smooth shield sports a giant emblem golden
790 Io raising horns a cow already clad
in hide and Argus the girls guardian Her father
Inachus pours water from the embossed urn
242

Next a cloud of infantry shields crowded
on the field Argive men Aurucan bands
Rutulians Sicanian veterans
a Sacranian column Labici with painted
shields those who farm the woods of Tiber
and Numicus sacred springs who till with rakes
Rutulian hills and Circes headland fields that Jove
800 guards with Feronia who loves green groves those who
hold Saturas pitchy marsh and the lowlands
where the icy Ufens plunges in the sea
To crown the men Camilla from the Volscians
a warriorqueen She leads a female cavalry
like blooms in bronze Not for her a womans tasks
Minervas spindle or a basket of wool skeins
Shes steeled for battle and outruns the winds on foot
Shed fly above the topmost tips of uncut stalks
and not hurt the tender ears when she did
810 or run across the sea skimming the high swells
and not splash her quick feet with the water
All the young men and a crowd of mothers
flood from homes and fields in wonder as she goes
gaping in amazement at the royal purple
cloaking her smooth shoulders the brooch clasping
her hair with gold the Lycian quiver that she carries
and the shepherds staff of irontipped myrtle

243

BOOK 8

As bugles blared their strident notes Turnus waved
the standard on Laurentums citadel spurred
his eager horse and clanged his sword and shield
At once all hearts were thrown in turmoil In the anxious
tumult Latium swore loyalty the young men
raged for war Messapus Mezentius
the mocker of the gods and Ufens led They called in
conscripts far and wide and stripped the fields of farmers
Venulus was sent to noble Diomedes
10 to ask for help He told him Trojans camped
in LatiumAeneas fleet had docked with his
defeated gods he claimed he was the fated king
Many tribes had allied with the Dardan chief
his name was heard through Latium What he
meant by these first steps what he wanted out of
war if Fortune favored him was perhaps clearer
to Diomedes than to Turnus or Latinus
This was the scene in Latium The Trojan hero
knew it all he tossed on a great tide of worry
20 His mind flew quickly here and there shifting
sides weighing all the optionsas quick
as water shimmers back a trembling light
244

when rays of sunshine or the radiant moon
land on the bronze bowl the beam flutters far
and wide then angles up and roams the ceiling

It was night Deep sleep held the weary animals
of all the lands the birds and beasts Father
Aeneas heartsick at the threat of war
lay down on the bank beneath the skys cold
30 canopy and finally let himself sleep
A local god old Tiberinus came to him
rising from his lovely stream among the poplar
branches He wore flowing graygreen linen
a crown of reeds shaded his hair He spoke
and eased Aeneas worries with these words
Goddessborn you restore our city Troy
and save her heights from enemies forever
Laurentian lands and Latin fields have longed
for you Heres your certain home your household gods
40 Dont give up or fear the threats of war
the gods swollen anger is all over
Soonin case you think this dreams a lie
youll find a giant sow by my banks oaks

By this sign youll know Ascanius will found
famed Alba after thirty years roll by
I foretell the truth Now take note heres how
to bring about whats needed for your victory

50 Pallas Arcadians who followed King

Evander in his war chose to settle here
They placed their city named Pallanteum
after their ancestor among the hills
They wage an endless war against the Latins
Bring them to your camp and make a treaty
I myself will guide you there along my banks
youll outpace the current with your oars
Up then goddessborn when the stars first set
60 give Juno her due prayers and calm her angry threats
with humble vows Honor me after youve won
youll see me grazing my banks in full flood
cutting through the loamy fields skyblue
Tiber the river heaven loves the most My great
home is here high Etrurias my source
He sank in the deep river plunging to its bed
Night and slumber left Aeneas He rose
and faced the suns glow in the eastern sky
then ritually cupped riverwater in his hands
70 and poured this prayer to the air Nymphs
Laurentian nymphs source of all the rivers and you
father Tiberinus with your sacred stream
accept Aeneas and protect him now at last
Pity my ordeals wherever your springs
rise whatever soil you well from in your glory
Ill always honor you with gifts and worship
hornd river ruler of Hesperias streams
Just stay close and make your omen true
Now he chose two galleys from his fleet
80 fitting them with rowers and armed men
246

But see a sudden marvel met their eyes
In the woods they saw a snowy sow
and her white litter lying on the grassy bank
Pious Aeneas killed the sow and piglets
for great Juno and set up an altar
All that nights full length Tiber calmed
his swell and kept his currents still His surface
was as level as a pond or placid swamp
no struggle for the oars going upstream
90 As cheers rose they hurried on their journey
the pitchglazed pine boats smoothly slipped along
The woods and waters by the banks were dazed to see
farflashing shields and painted keels in such a place
The men rowed day and night around long bends
Varied trees cast shade upon the ships that wove
their way through living woods on silent waters
When the blazing sun had scaled the heights of sky
they saw a distant citadel and scattered homes
Romes strength has since raised these to the heavens
100 but at that time Evanders state was poor indeed
At once they steered their prows toward the town
By chance that day Arcadias king was making
annual sacrifice in a forest near the city
honoring the gods and Hercules His son
Pallas other princes and the humble senate
offered incense with him The altars steamed with gore
When they saw the tall ships gliding from
the dusky trees the crews pulling silent oars
the sudden sight alarmed them They sprang up to leave
110 the sacred feast But brave Pallas would not let
247

the rite be interrupted He grabbed his spear
ran toward the ships and shouted from a knoll
Men why are you trying these uncharted paths
What is your race Your home Where are you heading
Do you bring peace or war From his high stern
Aeneas proffered a sprig of peaceful olive
You see armed Trojans hostile to the Latins
who rudely drove us off though were refugees
We look for Evander Take these words to him
120 leading Dardan chiefs come asking for a treaty
Pallas was struck dumb by Troys famous name
Disembark whoever you may be Address
my father face to face come to our home as guests
He took Aeneas hand and clung to it
as they left the river heading for the grove

Aeneas hailed the king with friendly words
Best of the sons of Greece Fortune saw fit
that I appeal to you with olive branches bound
by holy ribbons The fact that youre Arcadian
130 a Greek chief kin to Atreuss sonsthis
didnt alarm me Divine oracles my courage
our fathers shared blood and your vast fame
have joined us Fate leads with my consent
That Dardanus who sailed to the Troad
was Troys first father and her founder He was
son to Atlas child Electra so the Greeks say
that massive Atlas on whose back the earth
is balanced Now your fathers Mercury
248

Shining Maia had him on the snowy peak of
140 Mount Cyllene But tradition tells us Atlas
who holds up the stars was also Maias father
So our two peoples split off from one line
Believing this I refused to send you envoys
or make some crafty overture I risk my life
and approach your door as supplicant
Those Daunians that hunt you down in war
hunt us as well believing if they drive us out
nothing will prevent their taking Italy
Their rule will reach both seas that lap her shores
150 Lets make a pact We Trojans have hearts strong
in battle Were brave and our men are tried in war
Evander had been looking at his face
and eyes scanning all his body He said
How glad I am to welcome and acknowledge
the bravest of the Trojans How gladly I recall
the words and voice and face of great Anchises
Priam Laomedons son visited
our cold Arcadia from Salamis
the kingdom of Hesione his sister
160 At that time my first beard was mere fuzz
upon my cheeks I admired the Trojan chiefs
I admired Priam but Anchises walked
the tallest of them all I burned with boyish
longing to speak with the hero to clasp his hand
I happily escorted him to our city
Pheneus When he left he gave me gifts a lovely
quiver Lycian arrows a cloak of golden weave
a pair of golden bridles that my Pallas has
249

Well join our hands in treaty as you ask Youll go
170 home when dawn arrives glad to have my help
Ill offer what I have But now since youve
come as allies share our celebration
of these yearly rites we cant postpone them
and feel at home feasting among friends
Evander ordered that the cleared food and goblets
be reset He himself seated the guests
on grassy benches Aeneas had the place of honor
on a maple throne and shaggy lionskin
Men picked to help the altarpriest were quick
180 to carry out roast bulls They heaped the baskets
high with bread Ceres hardwon gift and offered
wine Aeneas and the Trojans shared the feast
whole sides of beef and organs vowed to gods
Their hunger gone their appetite now sated
King Evander said No blind superstition
no ignorance of early gods imposed on us
the habit of this ritual feast this altar to so
great a god We were saved Trojan guests
from awful danger For this we renew the rites
190 we owe Once there was a rocky cliff above us
now its mass is scattered far and wide The home
it held is empty its rocks a pile of ruin
but then it was a vast receding cavern
In it out of reach of sunny rays lurked
the horrible halfhuman Cacus The caves soil
steamed constantly with stillwarm slaughter Fixed to
the grim doors hung bloodless rotting heads
250

Vulcan sired the monster it was Vulcans black flames
that he spewed as he heaved himself around
200 At last time brought the help wed hoped a god
arrived He was the greatest of avengers
proud of butchering and looting Geryons
triple bulkHercules driving huge bulls
These cattle crammed the glen and riverbanks
But Cacus mind feral frenzied could leave
no crime or cunning undared or untried
He stole from their stabling seven perfect bulls
seven cows of startling grace To ensure
their tracks did not face forward the robber dragged them
210 by their tails to his cave all signs of their
route reversed and hid them in the sunless rock
No one could find tracks that pointed to the cavern
Meanwhile the other cows had grazed their fill
and Hercules was set to leave with all his cattle
Then the herds began to low They filled the glen
and hills with protest as they noisily departed
From the giant cave one cow mooed back and
though imprisoned shattered Cacus hopes
Hercules blazed up with anger and black bile
220 He grabbed his weapons and his heavy knotted
club and ran for the hills summit Just this
once we saw Cacus afraid terror in his
eyes He fled back to his cave faster than
the windit was fear that winged his feet
and shut himself inside breaking the iron chains
Vulcan had forged to hold a giant boulder
that hung at the entry It fell and blocked the access
Just then Hercules arrived in all his fury
251

He scanned the cliff looked here and there
230 and gnashed his teeth Three times he furiously
circled the Aventine Hill and stormed that rocky
entrance it was no use Three times he sank back
A flinty tower sheer on every side rose up
from the rooftop of the cave a fitting home
for stinking vultures nests It leaned to the left
toward the river Grabbing it he jammed it
hard the other way then tore it from its base
and hurled it down with force It landed with a crash
the heavens boomed the water in the stream
240 leapt up and fell back on itself in fear
Cacus cavern his huge home appeared
The dark grotto was laid open to its core
as if the earth had cracked under some force
gaping to the heart of Hell the pallid lands
loathed by the gods as if the vast abyss below
were visible and ghosts trembled at the light
Cacus was caught by the sudden glare and trapped
inside the hollow rock howling now
in a new key The heros arrows rained on him
250 and any weapons he could find branches and huge
boulders Cacus had to deal with the danger
He belched a giant smokecloud from his jaws
amazingly and wrapped his home in inky fog
stealing it from view From inside his cave
he spewed out smoky fire mixed with darkness
Hercules lost patience He took a headlong leap
right through the flames where the smoke seethed
densely black clouds warping in the heat
252

As Cacus spouted useless fire into the dark
260 the hero grabbed him in a strangling chokehold
His eyes bulged out and blood drained from his throat
His pitchblack lair lay open the doors ripped away
At once the stolen cattle and his lies
were exposed for all to see The monstrous corpse
was dragged out by the feet Our men could not
get their fill of looking at its awful eyes
and face the chest of matted hair his jaws dead flames
Since then grateful generations such as we
have marked this day Potitius established it
270 and now the Pinari watch over it
In a forest they set up this altar we call
greatest It will always be the greatest
Come men wreathe your hair with leaves to praise him
hold out goblets in your hands call on
our shared god offer him wine willingly
He veiled his hair with braided fronds of poplar
the dappled shady growth of Hercules tree
then took up a sacred goblet All were glad to
pour wine on the altar and call upon the gods
280 Meanwhile heaven circled and the sky grew dark

The priests led by Potitius and wearing pelts
the custom carried torches They resumed the feast
and brought in welcome offerings for the second course
heaping up the tables with the loaded plates
The Sali chanted around the lighted altars
their heads ringed with poplartwo choruses
one young one old to chant Hercules famous deeds
how he grabbed and throttled with his hand
253

snakes sent by his stepmother twin monsters
290 how he overthrew outstanding cities Troy and
Oechalia and endured a thousand
tasks set by Eurystheus and hostile Juno
Unconquered one you killed the cloudborn Centaurs
Pholus and Hylaeus with bare hands you killed
the Cretan hybrid and the giant Nemean lion
Stygian waters trembled and so did Orcus guard
lying on halfeaten bones in his bloodstained
cave No shape could scare younot even Typhoeus
towering and armed You devised a way
300 to kill the Hydra as its heads bobbed all around you
Hail true son of Jupiter the gods own glory
be present and support us and your rites
So they celebrated him in song with Cacus
cave as climax and the halfman breathing fire
The forests rang with sound the hills echoed it back
When the rites were over they turned back to town
The king proceeded slowly burdened by his age
He kept Pallas and Aeneas close
lightening the walk with varied tales
310 Aeneas admired everything Charmed by the site
he gladly looked at what Evander noted asking for
and hearing of the memories of men of old
King Evander founder of Romes stronghold said
Native fauns and nymphs once held these groves
and a race of men from hardy oaktree trunks
They had no culture and no customs no notion
of yoking bulls amassing wealth or storing food
Acorns fed them and huntings harsh livelihood
254

Saturn was first to come from high Olympus
320 fleeing war with Jupiter an exile with no
kingdom He united the unruly race
that was scattered on the mountains gave them laws
and called it Latiumhed safely hidden here
He was king during the age called Golden
and he ruled the people in unbroken peace
until a duller and degraded age came in
mad for war greedy for gain Then came
Ausonian mobs and Sicanian tribes
The land of Saturn often changed its name
330 Next came many kings and the cruel giant Thybris
we Italians named the river Tiber for him
The ancient name of Albula was lost And I
I was an exile sailing to the ends of Ocean
Ineluctable allpowerful Fate settled me
here The dread warnings of my mother the nymph
Carmentis drove me and the god Apollos plans
Evander pointed out the altar on their path
and the Carmental Gate so the Romans call it
an ancient tribute to the nymph Carmentis who sang
340 the fates and first foretold the future of Aeneas
noble sons and the famed Pallanteum
He showed the spacious grove used by stern Romulus
as a refuge then in a cliffs cool shade
the Lupercal named for Arcadias Lycian Pan
He marked out Argiletums sacred pasture
and swore that his guest Argus died right here Next
came the Tarpeian Rock and then the Capitol
golden now rough then with thorny thickets
255

Even then the eerie godhead of the place
350 alarmed the nervous farmers who trembled at the
woods and rock A god lives in this very grove
and leafy hill we dont know who Our men
believe they can see Jupiter himself shaking
his black shield in his hand and bringing storms
You see these two towns their walls in ruins
Theyre whats left of monuments to men of old
Janus founded this stronghold and Saturn that
ones Janiculum one Saturnia
With such talk they neared Evanders humble home
360 Herds were everywhere lowing in the Forum
and the grand Carinae When they reached
his house he said Triumphant Hercules
came in this door this kings lodging hosted him
My guest dare to despise wealth Be like
a god yourself Dont look down on my poverty
He led massive Aeneas under this narrow roof
and set him down on bedding the skinned pelt of
a Libyan bear on heapedup stacks of leaves
Night fell wrapping Earth with dusky wings
370 Venus fearful for her son and rightly fretful

at the Latins threats and angry clamor
now spoke to Vulcan in their golden bedroom
breathing divine love into her words
Dearest husband when Greek kings destroyed
doomed Troy and her citadel was falling
to the flames I didnt seek help for the victims
I didnt ask for weapons from your skill and strength
I didnt want your labor to be wasted
256

though I owed much to Priams sons and often
380 wept over Aeneas hardships Now as Jove
commands hes landed on Rutulian shores
So Ive come to beg you after allyou whom
I adoreto ask for weapons for my son
The mothers Thetis and Aurora moved you once
with tears See how nations mass how cities
sharpen swords behind locked gates to kill
my boy As Vulcan wavered Venus wrapped
her snowy arms around him in a soft embrace
At once he felt the wellknown flame It sank
390 into his bones and ran along his weakened frame
just as forked lightning and its flash of light
tear through dark clouds with a thundering crash
His wife knew her effect Her cunning pleased her
Vulcan bound by his undying love asked her
Why bring up the past Goddess wheres your faith
in me If youd worried then Id have justly
armed the Trojans Neither Fate nor mighty
Jupiter forbade Troy and king Priam
to survive for ten more years Now too
400 if you prepare to fight and your mind is set
any care I can promise in my art
whatever can be made with molten iron and
electrum whatever flames and wind can do
dont beg dont doubt your power He made love
to her as he desired Then lying draped
on his wifes breasts he let slumber wind through him
When a few hours of rest had banished sleep
he rose It was after midnight when a woman
257

forced to use Minervas loom to make her living
410 rises to add nighttime to her work and pokes
the dormant embers She calls the slaves to lamplight
for the lengthy work of cardingall to keep
her widowed bed untouched and raise the little ones
As industriously the lord of fire
left his downy bed to labor at the forge
An island rises near Lipare and the coast
of Sicily Its steep crusted in smoking rocks
Beneath it lie the caves of Etna eaten hollow
by the thunderous forges of the Cyclopes
420 Strong blows strike the shrieking anvils in the din
iron ingots hiss in furnaces with flames
dancing around them its Vulcans home Vulcania
The lord of fire flew here from the sky
Steropes Brontes and barearmed Pyragmon
were wielding iron in the massive cave
They held a roughly hammered thunderbolt
part polished part unformed The father of the gods
hurls these endlessly from sky to earth
Theyd soldered on three strikes of twisting hail
430 three each of storm red fire and winged south wind
They added terrifying flashes thunder
fear and the heat that follows rage
Elsewhere they were busy with Mars chariot
on flying wheels the one he rides to enflame men
and cities and polished eagerly a ghastly shield
for angered Pallas it had golden serpent scales
intertwining snakes and at the center
headless Gorgon still too grim to look at
Cyclopes of Etna he yelled Drop your work
258

440 set aside your projects pay attention

We must forge weapons for a fierce warrior
Nows the time for strength quick hands and expert skill
Hurry At this they set to work at once
splitting up the tasks Bronze and gold ore
ran in rivulets wounding chalyb melted
in a massive furnace They made a giant shield
to equal all the weapons of the Latins welding
it with seven layers circle upon circle
Some drew in air and pumped it out with puffing bellows
450 others tempered hissing bronze in water
The cave groaned with the anvils weight Their arms
swung in a forceful rhythm up and down
as they twisted hot ore with their gripping tongs
While the lord of Lemnos urged this work on them
the gentle light and sunrise song of birds
called Evander from his humble home
The old man rose wrapped his body in a tunic
and tied on Tuscan sandals He attached a swordbelt
to his side and took up a Tegean shield
460 A cloak of panthers hide hung at his left
Two watchdogs went before him crossing the high
threshold and matched their masters steps The hero
headed for the sheltered lodging of his guest
Aeneas mindful of his promise to give aid
Aeneas too was up this early With Evander
had come Pallas with Aeneas Achates
They met clasped hands and sat down in the courtyard
At last they could have a frank exchange
King Evander started Greatest leader
259

470 of the Trojans while you live I wont

admit Troys kingdom has collapsed despite
our fame our resources for war are thin
Tuscan Tiber hems us on one side Rutulians
threaten on the other Their weapons clang around
our town But I have allies for you large nations
and armed camps with many kingdoms Fortune gives
this unexpected aidyour presence must be fated
Not far from here theres a city built of ancient
stone Agylla where the Lydians famed
480 in battle once settled the Tuscan hills
But this town that flowered many years fell to
King Mezentius cruel and brutal rule
I wont dwell on this tyrants godless murders
or barbarity May the gods store it all up
for him and his He used to yoke the living
to the dead hand to hand and face to face
a form of torture so they died a lingering death
dripping pus and gore within that grim embrace
At last the citizens sick of this horror took up
490 arms and blocked the madman in his home
They killed his allies and threw torches on his roof
But in the carnage he escaped to the Rutulians
Now hes defended by his ally Turnus army
All Etruria has risen up in rightful outrage
They want the king for punishment or else its war
Aeneas Ill make you leader of these thousands
whose ships are packed along the shore They shout
for battles start but an ancient seer stops them
by singing of the fates Lydias chosen men
500 finest flower of an ancient race righteous
260

anger at Mezentius drives you to war
But no Italian may guide your great people
You must await a foreign leader Fearing
the gods warning theyve pitched camp on this plain
Now Tarchon sends me envoys with a crown
and scepter hoping that Ill join the camp
and take the Tuscan throne But my old age
worn out by years cold and sluggish grudges me
such leadership Im too old for daring deeds
510 Id urge my son but his mother Sabellas
Italian and his blood is mixed Fate favors
your age your race and the gods ask for you
march on bravest chief of Trojans and Italians
And Ill lend you Pallas my hope and comfort
hell learn to be a soldier and do Mars grim
labor from your leadership Let him
admire you from the start From me hell have
two hundred horsemen the core of our strength
and hell bring as many on his own account
520 Staunch Achates and Aeneas remained still

eyes fixed on the ground brooding over
all their hardships with sad hearts But now
Venus sent a signal from the cloudless sky
A sudden booming lightning bolt came flashing
from above The world seemed to reel
the ring of Tuscan trumpets sounded through the air
As they looked up thunder cracked repeatedly
Where the sky was clear they saw a single cloud
in it swords appeared to turn bloodred and clash
530 The others were astonished but the Trojan hero
261

knew the thunder of his divine mothers pledge
My host he said theres no need to ask
what these signs mean Olympus summons me
My goddess mother said shed send this omen
if war was imminent and bring Vulcans armor
from the sky to help What carnage is in store
for the poor Laurentians Turnus how youll
pay Tiber how many helmets shields and bodies
of the brave youll tumble in your stream
540 Let the Latins break the treaty and wage war
Aeneas spoke and rose from where he sat
He lit Herculess smoking altars gladly
honoring the humble housegods as hed done
the day before Evander offered chosen sheep
as due the Trojans did the same Afterward
Aeneas went back to his crews still at the ships
and chose the bravest men to follow him to war
The others glided downstream on the rivers
helpful current bringing news of these affairs
550 and of his father to Ascanius Trojans
bound for Tuscan fields were given horses
For Aeneas they brought a special one it wore
a tawny lion pelt that gleamed with gilded claws
Rumor flew right through the little town at once
horsemen were riding fast for Tuscan lands
Frightened mothers renewed prayers fear grew
with danger and wars specter now loomed larger
As Pallas left Evander clasped his hand clinging
to his son sobbing inconsolably
262

560 If only Jupiter would give me back my youth

the man I was when I subdued the front lines
at Praeneste and burned great piles of shields
I sent King Erulus to Hell by this right hand
Feronia his mother gave him three lives at birth
dreadful to tell and three sets of armor
I had to strike him down three times but still
this hand took those triple lives and triple armor
Then Id never be wrenched from your sweet embrace
my son Mezentius would not have put so many
570 to the sword insulting me his neighbor
our town would not be widowed all the time
O powers above and Jupiter great ruler
of the gods pity this Arcadian king I beg
hear a fathers prayer If fate and your strength
keep my Pallas safe if Ill live to see him
and rejoin him let me live I can endure
anything But Fortune if you threaten
the unspeakable let me cut off this cruel
life right now while my worry is still vague
580 while theres halting hope for whats to come
while I hold you dear son my late and only
joy May no painful news come to these ears
As he poured this out at their last meeting
he collapsed The houseslaves carried him inside
Now the cavalry left from the open gates
Aeneas and loyal Achates in the lead
then the other Trojan princes Among his troops
Pallas stood out in his cloak and ornamented
armorlike the Morning Star still wet with Oceans
263

590 waves his sacred face rising to dispel darkness

Venus favorite among the fiery stars
The anxious mothers stood along the walls watching
the dusty cloud and troops gleaming in bronze
They rode with weapons through the brush the shortest way
A shout went up and all fell into line
their horses pounding hooves crumbled the soil
There was a grove by cool Caeres stream
held holy far and wide by ageold traditions
It was ringed all round by hills of somber spruce
600 The storys that the old Pelasgians the first
to live in Italy vowed it to Silvanus
god of fields and flocks and chose his holy day
Tarchon and the Tuscans made camp nearby
in a safe place From the heights all the legions
could be seen their tents pitched through the fields
Aeneas joined them with his chosen warriors
Tired they tended to their horses and themselves
Now Venus shining goddess came with gifts
through heavens clouds From afar she saw her son
610 in a secluded valley alone by a cold stream
She appeared to him and spoke these words
Look your gifts perfected by my husbands
art as promised So my son dont hesitate
to call to war fierce Turnus and the proud
Laurentians She embraced her child and set
his gleaming weapons by an oak Aeneas
delighted by this honor couldnt get his fill of
looking at the goddess gifts In awe he scanned
each detail turning over in his hands
264

620 the helmet pouring out its flamelike crest

the deadly sword the breastplate stiff with bronze
massive bloodred like a dark cloud set afire
by the suns bright rays and blazing in the sky
the smooth greaves of electrum and forged gold the spear
and the shields engraving complex beyond words
The lord of fire who knew of prophecies about
ages to come had carved on it Italys history
Roman triumphs all the generations of
Ascaniuss line and their wars in sequence
630 Hed carved a shewolf sprawled in Mars green grotto
Shed whelped and twin boys played around her teats
hanging on them suckling on their mother
without fear She nuzzled them in turn bending
her soft neck licking their forms into shape
Vulcan set Rome nearby and the Sabines
lawlessly abducted from the theater
at the Circus Games and a sudden war
with old Tatius and his severe Cures
Next the same two kings stood armed before Joves
640 altar their conflict laid aside holding bowls
Theyd sacrificed a pig to sanctify their peace
Close by chariot teams had charged apart
dismembering Mettus he should have kept his word
Tullus dragged the traitors entrails through the wood
the thorns were drenched with bloody dew Porsenna
ordered Rome to take back banished Tarquin
and ringed the city with a massive siege
Aeneas heirs died on the swords for liberty
See his lifelike lookmenacing and angry
650 because Cocles dared to wreck the bridge
265

Cloelia to break her chains and swim the river
Manlius guarding the Tarpeian fort
the temple and high Capitol was at the top
Romuluss roof was bristly with new thatch
A silver goose flapped in a golden portico
warning that the Gauls were at the gates
They lurked in the bush about to take the fort
covered by the dark the gift of inky night
Their flowing hair was gold their clothes were gold
660 their striped cloaks gleamed twisted gold circled
their milky necks In their hands were glinting
double Alpine spears long shields hid their bodies
Hed pounded out the leaping Sali and naked
priests of Pan their caps tufted with wool and shields
fallen from the sky In cushioned carriages
chaste mothers carried sacred vessels through the town
Far off he placed Tartarus and Dis high gates
the wages of wickedness and Catiline
dangling from an overhang fearful of the
670 Furies The pious were set apart receiving
Catos laws Between it all flowed Oceans image
a golden swell with dark blue whitecapped waves
Around the rim silver dolphins swept the surface
with their tails cutting through the surging sea
In the center sailed bronze warships they fought
the sea battle of Actium Cape Leucas its waves
bright with gold frothed with the armada
Here Augustus Caesar led all Italy
to war the Senate people gods of sky and hearth
680 From high on the stern his bright brow poured
266

twin flames his fathers comet rose above
Tall Agrippa steered the fleet with gods and winds
behind him He wore a naval crown on it gleamed
bright images of prows a martial honor
Antony was opposite with Asian wealth
and hodgepodge troops victor over Eastern hordes
and the Red Sea He brought Egypt Eastern might
distant Bactraand for shame a wife from Egypt
The forces smashed together and the whole sea frothed
690 torn by oars and threespiked beaks of boats
The crews made for the open Massive ships rammed towering
sternsyoud think the Cyclades torn up were free
to roam the waters or that mountains smashed together
Flaming flax and flying spears rained from their hands
and justspilled blood turned Neptunes fields red
In the thick of it the queen called to her fleet
with her native rattlenot seeing the pair of snakes
behind her Monstrous mongrel gods and barking
Anubis turned weapons against Venus Neptune
700 and Minerva Iron Mars was in their midst mad
for battle Awful Furies swooped in from the sky
and Discord in her tattered cloak joined gladly
Bellona followed with her bloody whip
Apollo saw this from his shrine and aimed his bow
At that every Indian and Egyptian
every Arab and Sabaean cut and ran
The queen herself was calling to the winds
loosening the lanyards in flight under full sail
The lord of fire made her pale with future death
710 swept by waves and wind amid the sea of blood
Opposite hed carved the mighty Nile in mourning
267

opening his garments folds welcoming
the conquered to his bluegreen bays and hidden streams
But Caesar rode to Rome in triple triumph and made
the gods of Italy an immortal vow
three hundred spacious shrines across the city
The roads rang with joy applause and revelry
Bands of women were at every shrine and altar
where slaughtered calves covered the ground He himself
720 seated by the snowy marble temple of bright
Apollo reviewed the nations gifts to be fastened

BOOK 9


While these events unfolded far away Juno
Saturns daughter sent Iris from the sky to find
bold Turnus By chance he was sitting in a sacred
valley in his ancestor Pilumnus woods
Iris child of Thaumas spoke to him from rosy
lips Turnus times orbit brings you freely what
no god would dare to promise Aeneas leaves
his camp his fleet and troops making for
Evanders palace on the Palatine
10 then farther still all the way to distant towns
in Corythus to arm a band of Lydian farmers
Dont wait nows the time to call for horse and
chariot Surprise their camp and storm it
With this she rose into the sky on level wings
drawing a huge arc beneath the clouds
Turnus knew her He stretched up his hands
following her flight with words Iris heavens
glory who sent you to me from the clouds
Theres a sudden glimmer in the air the sky
20 divides to show the circling constellations
Ill follow this great omen no matter who
calls me to war He approached the stream

269

and drank from its clear surface then begged the gods
at length his prayers piling in the sky

All the army now marched on the open fields
rich in horsemen sumptuous garb and gold
Messapus rallied the front lines Tyrrhus sons
the rear Turnus led the columns center
30 They moved like the silent swell of the deep Ganges
fed by seven gentle streams like the Niles
lifegiving water when it overflows then ebbs
Suddenly the Trojans saw a dusty black cloud
taking shape darkness shadowing the plain
From the ramparts Caius was the first to shout
Whats that swirling globe of dirt and dust
Quick bring swords and spears man the walls
the enemys upon us Clattering they
retreated through the gates and crammed into the camp
40 This was the mighty warrior Aeneas order
as he left in case of crisis they shouldnt dare
to draw up ranks or trust to open battle
but guard the camp within the safety of the walls
So though shame and rage called them to fight
they blocked the gates and followed orders armed
inside the towers waiting for the enemy
Turnus took twenty from the cavalry and rode
ahead his horse a snowy dappled Thracian his helmet
gold and crimsoncrested The army followed him
50 He caught the camp unready Men he cried
270

who comes with me whos first to charge the enemy
He hurled his spear through the air an overture
to war and raced across the plain His men
took up his shout and followed with a curdling cry
They marveled at the Trojans coward heartshow they
shunned the battle on the field and sat snug
in their camp Turnus frantic for an entrance
rode back and forth to scan the walls Nothing
As a wolf prowls around a crowded sheepfold
60 howling by its gate pelted in the dark
by wind and rain while ewes keep safe the lambs
bleating beneath them beside himself the wolf
is mad for what he cannot have exhausted
by long famine his dry jaws parched for blood
just so Turnus anger flared up as he probed
the walls and camp Rage burned in his bones
How could he find an entrance How shake out
the nesting Trojans and spill them on the plain
Their fleet was anchored near the camp guarded
70 on each side by earthworks and the river
He called for fire from his cheering friends
took up a flaming brand and stormed the ships
His men leapt to work spurred by Turnus presence
All took up lit torches looted from the fires
The pitchsmeared pine produced a sooty light
and Vulcan wafted sparks and ashes to the stars
What god O Muses repelled the hungry blaze
Who kept the fire from the fleet Tell me
Ancient times trusted this tale its fame lives on
80 When Aeneas first built his fleet on Phrygian Ida
271

to sail the oceans depths Cybele so they say
mother of the gods addressed great Jupiter
My son since youve tamed Olympus grant
this favor that your loving mother asks
On a mountain summit was a grove I loved
for many years where people brought me offerings
Pitchpine trees and maples lent it murky shade
I gave it to Aeneas when he needed ships
and gladly so but fear makes me anxious now
90 Comfort me and grant your mothers prayer dont let
the boats be swamped at sea by waves or whirlwinds
Let it help them that my mountain was their home
Her son who spins the constellations said Mother
how would you bend fate What is this hope
Should boats produced by mortal hands enjoy
immortal rights Should Aeneas confront danger
without danger What god has such power
But when their task is done when theyve reached the ports
of Italy Ill take away the earthly form
100 of the boats who brought Trojan Aeneas
to Laurentian fields and make them ocean
goddesses like Doto the Nered
or Galatea fronting seafoam as they swim
He swore this by his Stygian brothers streams
the banks that boil with pitch the black abyss
shaking all Olympus with his nod
The promised day had come and the Fates discharged
the debt of time Turnus onslaught cued the Mother
to keep the sacred fleet safe from the fire
110 First a strange light blazed before their eyes
272

From the east a huge cloud carrying the goddess
worshippers traversed the heavens Then a dreadful
voice boomed down and deafened both the armies
Trojans dont be anxious to defend my ships
or fight Turnus cant burn down my sacred fleet
any more than burn the waves Goddesses
go freely your Mother commands you At once
the boats broke off their moorings from the bank
and dived down to the depths plunging in beakfirst
120 as dolphins do Then a miracle to tell
nymphs in equal numbers rose to ride the waves
The Rutulians were stunned the horses reared
even Messapus felt fear The Tiber slowed
its raucous course then retreated from the sea
Yet this barely touched bold Turnus confidence
Instead he raised their spiritsand added a rebuke
These omens target Trojans Jove himself
held back his usual help from themwe didnt
130 need to torch the boats Now these men cant cross
the sea and theres nowhere to run Half the world
is out of reach we control this land and countless
weapons arm the tribes of Italy The gods signs
that the Trojans boast of scare me not at all
The fates and Venus have their due Phrygians reached
the fertile soil of Italy And heres my fate
to extirpate this evil race who stole my wife
That pain doesnt only touch the sons of
Atreus just wars are fought by others too
140 Its enough that Troy fell once That they stole once
should be enough youd think theyd shun
273

all women now Their barricades and ditches
give them heartsmall delays before their death
Didnt they see the walls of Troy collapse in flames
Those were built by Neptunes hand My chosen band
whos prepared to follow me to wreck the ramparts
with his sword and storm the quaking camp
I dont need Vulcans armor or a thousand ships
to fight the Teucrians All Tuscany can join them
150 No need for them to fear the night cowards
stealing the Palladium murdered sentries
on the heights or a horses hidden womb
Well ring their walls with fire in the light of day
Ill make sure they realize theyre not facing
the Greek soldiers Hector held off for ten years
But now the better part of day is done
Rest yourselves for what remains be happy
with a job well done and expect a fight
Messapus was told to block the gates with
160 sentries and set watchfires round the walls
Rutulians were picked to guard the camp
fourteen of them Each led a hundred men
purpleplumed and bright with golden armor
They dispersed taking up the watch in turn
or sprawling on the grass enjoying wine
tilting back bronze winebowls The fires twinkled
as the sentries passed the sleepless night in games
The Trojans watched this from the ramparts on guard
with their weapons Worrying they checked
170 the gates built high gangways linking towers
and stockpiled spears Fierce Serestus and Mnestheus
274

spurred them on These two were Aeneas choice
as the soldiers leaders their strategists in crisis
The whole force on the walls shared in the risks
of nightwatch each man at a post assigned by lot
Nisus fearless in a fight guarded the gate
Hyrtacus son quick with lances and light arrows
whom the huntress Ida sent to serve Aeneas
His friend was Euryalus Among the troops
180 there was no warrior more handsomea boy
whose unshaved chin showed pubertys first fuzz
They shared one mind one heart they rushed to battle
side by side Now they shared watch at the gate
Nisus asked Do gods enflame our hearts
Euryalus or do our fierce desires become
our gods Im not content with idleness
Ive long been keen to fight to do something
heroic You see how cocksure these Rutulians are
Their fires are far apart and theyre sprawled around
190 slack with wine and sleep Alls quiet So hear
what Ive been wondering how my thoughts are taking shape
The leaders and the army want to send news
to Aeneas and recall him to the camp
If they give you my reward the glory of
the exploit is enough for me I think I see
a path along that hill to Pallanteums walls
Euryalus was stunned A deep desire struck him
to win fame too and he asked his fervent friend
Nisus Im not included in this crucial mission
200 Im supposed to send you into danger all
alone Thats not how my father taught mewarsteeled
275

Opheltes who raised me during the Greek horror
and Troys hardships Thats not how Ive acted
at your side risking death for great Aeneas
I scorn the light of day To me this fame you want
is a bargain at the cost of losing life
Nisus said I hardly feared you were a coward
the thought I swear it by my hopes that Jove
or any god whos just brings me back a victor
210 But if as often happens in this sort of plan
some god or chance puts me in jeopardy
I want you to survive Youre young you deserve
to live If my bodys rescued or else ransomed
I need you to bury me If Fortune wont
allow that gift my absence with a tomb
and funeral I dont want to bring such grief
to your poor mother the only one of all of them
who dared to follow you and leave Acestes town
Euryalus said You can grope for reasons
220 theres no point I wont change my mind
Lets go He roused some guards to take their place
and keep the watch in turn then left his post
heading off with Nisus to locate their king
All the other living things throughout the land
were giving up their cares to sleep their hearts
at rest from trouble But a chosen set
of Trojan leaders were conferring on the crisis
What to do Who should take a message to
Aeneas They stood in the middle of the camp
230 leaning on long spears gripping shields
Both Nisus and Euryalus begged urgently
276

to be admitted at once on a crucial matter
worth the time Ilus let the eager pair
join in and told Nisus to speak Hyrtacus
son began Aeneas generals hear us fairly
Dont judge our offer by our age The Rutulians
are silent slack with wine and sleep Weve found
a place to bypass them a spot to sneak through
by the gate thats closest to the sea
Some sentry fires are out others sputter
240 smokily If youll let us take this chance
to reach Aeneas in Pallanteum well be
back here soon with spoils from many dead
We wont get lost weve often hunted in the
dark dells near the city and we know the river
At this Aletes bent with years but wise of mind
said Gods of Troy whose power guards us always
you dont intend to ruin the Trojans after all
Such brave young men youve given us such steadfast
250 hearts Tears streaming down his face
he clasped their shoulders and right hands What gifts
you two what presents could be worthy of your
bravery The gods and your own conduct
will grant the first and finest one Pious Aeneas
will swiftly give the rest as will Ascanius
still so young wholl recall this all his life
Ascanius broke in In fact I beg you both
since Im only safe if Fathers back
by our great housegods Assaracus Lar
260 and whitehaired Vestas shrine I place my life
my trust in you Bring back my father set him
in my sight Once hes here all will be well
277

Ill give you double goblets chased in silver
that my father took after Arisbas fall
two tripods two large golden ingots and an antique
bowl Sidonian Dido gave to me
If we seize the soil and scepter of this land
when I give out spoils by lot Ill put aside
the horse that Turnus rode and his golden armor
270 you saw them Nisusto be yours your prize
that horse the shield and Turnus crimson plumes
Father will include twelve slavegirls chosen
for their beauty and male captives with their weapons
And more all the land that King Latinus owns
Euryalus amazing boy your age is nearer
to mine I take you as my friend with all my heart
to come with me no matter what I face
Ill never look for glory in your absence
In peace and war in words and deeds youre the one
280 Ill trust the most Euryalus replied
No day will see me falling short of todays daring
as long as Fortune smiles on us But besides
these many gifts I ask one thing I have a mother
from Priams ancient race Poor thing neither Troy
nor King Acestes town kept her from coming
with me I havent told her of my mission
which may be dangerous nor have I said goodbye
becauseI swear by night and your right hand
I couldnt bear to see her tears I beg you
290 help her in her need and loneliness
Let me take this hope with me and Ill go
still more bravely into danger This moved
278

the Dardans and they wept handsome Ilus
above all The image of this filial love
tore at his heart He responded Ill do
everything your great feat earns for you
Shell be a mother to meonly the name Creusa
will be lacking No small thanks await her
for raising such a son Whatever happens I swear
300 by my own life as my father used to do
the gifts I promise if your mission turns out well
those will still go to your mothers family
In tears he untied his gilded sword
and ivory scabbard Lycaon of Knossos
forged it long ago with wondrous skill
Mnestheus gave a lionskin torn from
a shaggy beast loyal Aletes traded helmets
They armed and left at once the group of leaders
young and old saw them to the gate
310 Handsome Ilus too mature before his years
and with a grown mans cares gave them many
mandates for his father But the breezes
dispersed his words into the clouds unheard
They crossed the trenches to the fatal camp
in dark of night bringing death to many
on the way They saw bodies everywhere
sprawled throughout the grass in drunken sleep
chariots propped up on the shore men lying
among the wheels and harnesses wine goblets
and weapons Hyrtacus son spoke first
Euryalus its time to strike the moments here
320 and sos our path Keep watch against an ambush
279

from the rear Be careful look around you
Ill make this camp a graveyard and clear us a wide swath
Then he fell silent With his sword he crept
toward proud Rhamnes who by chance was sleeping
on a layered heap of rugs and snoring loudly
He was a king and augur loved by Turnus but his
skill did not prevent his death Near him Nisus
killed three slaves who rashly slept among the weapons
330 then Remus armorbearer and charioteer slashing
their drooping necks as they slept under their horses
Next he struck away their masters head leaving
his body sobbing blood warm gore soaked the earth
and bedding He killed Lamyrus and Lamus
then youthful Serranus famous for his looks
whod played cards until the early hours then
succumbed to winehappier if hed only
played all night and carried on to dawn
He was like a starving lion bringing chaos
340 to a sheepfold when mindless hunger makes him tear
the soft sheep mute with fear he roars with bloody jaws
Euryalus matched Nisus killing On fire himself
he mowed down the rank and file before him
Abaris Fadus and Herbesusall unaware
But Rhoetus was awake and saw it all
Terrified he crouched behind a giant winejar
As he tried to rise Euryalus drove in
his sword and took it back dripping with death
Rhoetus crimson life pumped out a mix of blood
350 and wine The Trojan pressed on eagerly
Messapus allies his next target He saw
the outer fires dead and tethered horses cropping
280

grass But Nisus sensed his friend was lost
to lust for slaughter He said briefly Lets go Dawn
no friend of ours is near Enough revenge
Weve hacked a passage through the enemy
They left behind many solid silver weapons
also bowls and gorgeous rugs Euryalus
took Rhamnes breastplate and goldstudded swordbelt
360 gifts that rich King Caedicus once sent to
Remulus of Tibur his distant guestfriend
In death Remulus bequeathed them to his grandson
With his death the Rutulians took his warspoils
Euryalus put these on his sturdy shoulders
they wouldnt save him with Messapus strong helmet
and fine crest They left the camp making for safety

Just now horsemen chanced to come from Latium
Volcens led three hundred armed with shields
They were bringing Turnus a response
370 while the army waited drawn up in the fields
As they neared the camps defenses they saw
these two veering left far off In the predawn
gloom Euryalus helmet mirrored
the moons rays and betrayed the thoughtless boy
Taking note Volcens shouted from the ranks
Halt Why are you on the road Why armed
Where are you going The two made no reply
but ran still faster to the woods trusting to
the dark The horsemen blocked the roadsthey knew
380 them welland set guards at the exits The woods
281

bristled far and wide with thickets and black
holmoaks dense brambles clustered all around
A narrow passage glimmered through the shrouded paths
The forests darkness and his heavy plunder slowed
Euryalus and his fear misled him
But Nisus had escaped the troops in a blind rush
past a spot later called Alban after Alba
where Latinus had his stables He stopped then
looking for his missing friend in vain
390 Poor Euryalus where did I lose you Which way
should I go He traced back every winding trail
of that tricky forest looking for his tracks
wandering through the silent brush He heard
horses and a hubbub proof of the pursuers
It wasnt long till shouting reached his ears
and he saw Euryalus tricked by night
and forest and the sudden skirmish struggling wildly
as the troop of horsemen dragged him off
What should he do How could he save the boy
400 Should he throw himself at them though doomed
and die a noble death among their swords
Quickly he drew back his arm to hurl his spear
looking up at the high moon and praying
You goddess Latonas daughter glory
of the stars and guardian of the woods help me
in my trouble If my father brought your altars
gifts from me if I offered wild game from
my hunts and hung them from your dome and sacred roof
guide my spear let me break apart their band
410 He hurled his weapon using all his strength
The flying shaft severed nights shadow
282

It struck Sulmos back and snapped piercing
his heart with shattered wood He slumped to earth
Warm streams pumped from his chest and long convulsions
shook him he grew cold The group stared round
Nisus fiercer still wielded a new spear
by his ear He hurled the hissing weapon
at the panicked men It went through Tagus temples
sticking there warming in his punctured brain
420 Savage Volcens raged but couldnt see who threw
the spear nor where to aim his furious attack
Instead he turned his bare blade on Euryalus
and said You will pay me with hot blood
for both my men At this Nisus insane
with terror no longer hiding in the dark unable
to endure such pain called out Its me
me Rutulians I did it turn your swords
on me I attacked you He didnt couldnt
dare it I swear by the sky and knowing stars
430 He just loved his wretched friend too much
But as he spoke the sword plunged violently
through Euryalus ribs ripping open
his white chest He crumpled dying Blood
ran down his lovely body his neck slumped
like a purple flower cut down by a plow
bending as it dies like a poppys drooping
neck when heavy rain drags down its head
Nisus rushed at them But among them all
he aimed for Volcens only took time for him alone
440 The soldiers crowded him jabbing with spears
to drive him off He fought on still His sword
283

swung round like lightning till he shoved it into
Volcens shouting face He killed him and died
pierced through and through flinging himself
on his friends corpse finding peace at last in death
Lucky pair If my song has any power
no day will steal you from times memory while
Aeneas people settle by the Capitols
unmoving stone and a Roman father rules
450 The Rutulian victors took up their spoils

In tears they carried Volcens body back to camp
Their grief was not reduced by bloodless Rhamnes
near the tents by Serranus Numa and
so many leaders killed together They rushed
as one to the dead and dying men The ground
was warm with gore and streams of foaming blood
The spoils were recognized Messapus gleaming helmet
and his breastplates emblems rewon with so much sweat
Dawn was sprinkling new light on the lands
460 rising early from Tithonus saffron bed
As sunlight soaked the world and laid it bare
Turnus armed himself and roused his men to fight
Each chief marshaled his bronzearmored ranks
for war whetting their rage with varied rumors
They stuck the heads of Nisus and Euryalus
on pikes held high heartrending to see
and marched behind them with loud battlecries
Aeneas hardened men stationed their front lines
to the ramparts left the right side touched the river
284

470 guarding the deep ditches or sadly manning

the high turretsheartsick at the impaled heads
oozing with black blood of men they knew so well
Winged Rumor flew across the anxious camp
and stole into the ears of the dead boys mother
At once warmth left her bones poor thing The shuttle
tumbled from her hands its wool unwinding
She leapt up in agony and tore her hair
shrilling in a womans grief madly running
for the ramparts and front guard forgetting soldiers
480 spears and danger pouring pain into the sky
Is this you Euryalus Is this the comfort
kept for my old age My cruel son you left me
Sent off to such danger you didnt pause to say
goodbye to your unhappy mother Now youre dead
carrion for Latin dogs and birds
in a foreign land I cant take your body
to the pyre close your eyes and wash your wounds
or warm you with the robe Id woven day and night
racing time the shuttle soothing my old years
490 Where can I go What place has your severed
mangled corpse This head is all youve left me
son This is what I followed over land and
sea Rutulians show your piety
throw your weapons at me kill me first
Or you great father of the gods take pity
use your bolt to plunge my hateful soul to Hades
if thats the only way this bitter life can end
They were stricken at her cries A sad groan ran
through all of them their strength for battle drained
285

500 She was stirring too much grief Ilioneus

and weeping Ilus ordered Actor and Idaeus
to carry her inside and lay her down
The trumpet blared its terrible bronze notes
from far A shout went up the heavens bellowed back
The Volscians raced up under overlapping shields
keen to fill the ditches and tear down the walls
Some tried to breach the camp leaning ladders on the
walls where the ranks were thin where the ring
of soldiers showed a gap But long war had taught
510 the Trojans how to defend walls They rained down
varied missiles dislodging men with sturdy pikes
rolling rocks of deadly weight eager to break
through to the protected ranks The Latins huddling
under their locked shields took pleasure in their safety
But this was not enough since the Trojans dropped
a giant boulder where the hostile throng
was thickest It sent Rutulians flying far and wide
breaking their roof of shields The bold Rutulians
had no wish to keep on fighting blindly
520 Instead they tried to clear the walls by hurling spears
Elsewhere grim to see Mezentius brandished
torches made of Tuscan pine hurling smoky fire
while Neptunes son Messapus the horsetamer
tore at the defenses and demanded ladders
Calliope I pray you and your sisters inspire
me to sing of all the carnage there the deaths
dispensed by Turnus the killers and the victims
Unroll with me the length and breadth of war
286

A turret with high gangways towered near
530 the camp a vital spot which the Italians
tried with all their strength to storm and topple
The Trojans fought to save it crowding by
the open oylets to fling stones and spears
Turnus was the first to hurl a burning torch
The flame clung to the wall Fanned by wind
it consumed the planks and climbed the beams
Inside chaos and terror Soldiers frantic to get
out were trapped They retreated in a huddle
540 to the safer side Suddenly the tower
caved under their weight The sky roared with the crash
Halfdead men rained down and the huge fort followed
impaling them with weapons and hard timbers
Only Helenor and Lycus made it out
Helenor was in the prime of life a bastard
son the Lydian king had sired on a slave
Licymnia Although it was forbidden he fought
in battle with just a sword and unmarked shield
When he found himself among Turnuss
550 thousands the Latin legions all around
he was like a wild beast closeringed by hunters
raging at their weapons courting death
on purpose leaping onto their tall spears
just so about to die he flung himself
where he saw the hostile speartips thickest
Swift Lycus sprinted through the swords and men
and reached the walls He scrabbled for the top
stretching up to grasp his comrades hands
But Turnus had kept up armed and right behind him
560 Catching him he chided Fool you thought
287

you could escape my grasp He seized him as he dangled
and pulled a huge chunk of the wall away with him
like Joves lightningcarrier the eagle who grabs
a hare or snowy swan in his hooks then soars
or like a wolf Mars beast stealing a lamb
out of the fold as its mother searches bleating
The Latins charged with warcries they filled the ditches
and flung flaming torches on the roofs
With a giant rock Ileoneus killed
570 Lucetius as he neared the gate with firebrands
Liger good with lances killed Emathion
Asilas arrow unseen brought down Coryneus
from afar Turnus slaughtered Caeneus whod killed
Ortygius Itys Dioxippus
Clonius Promolus Sagaris
and Idas on the turret Capys killed Privernus
whom Themillas spear had grazedthe fool dropped his
shield to clutch his wound the gliding arrow pierced him
on the left and tunneled deep tearing
580 the pathways of his breath a lethal wound
Arcens son was close in striking armor
and an embroidered cloak bright with Spanish red
a handsome boy sent by his father who had
raised him in Mars grove near Symaethus streams
where Palicus has altars with rich offerings
Mezentius threw down his spears whirled a hissing
sling three times around his head and threw
He split open the boys forehead with hot
lead and sprawled him on a sandbank dead
590 Its said this was the first time that Ascanius

288

let arrows fly in war Before hed only scared
the skittish wild beasts His strong hand killed
Numanus Remulus now Turnus kin
hed married Turnus younger sister This man strode
in front of the battleline shouting abuse
not all fit to tell swollen up with
his new kingdom strutting his bulk around
Twicebeaten Phrygians Youre not ashamed to hide
behind ramparts again delaying death with walls
600 See these types whod seize our wives in war
What god what lunacy drove you to Italy
There are no sons of Atreus here no lying
Ulysses Were a flinty race We take our newborns
to the streams and steel them in the icy water
Our sons stay up to hunt wearing out the woods
Their play is breaking colts and shooting arrows
Our men dont tire of work They live off little
they tame the earth with hoes they humble towns in war
Spears shape our liveswe use their butts
610 to drive our oxen Slow old age cant sap
our bravery nor mute our vigor We hide
our gray hair with a helmet and never stop
collecting spoils to live on But you Your clothes
have violet and saffron stitching your hobbys
laziness you love to dance your tunics
have long sleeves and your hats are bonnets
O Phrygian ladies no men here go prance over
Mount Dindymas ridge where the double flute plays
your sort of tunes Your tambourines and Mother Idas
620 boxwoods call you Leave the weapons to real men

289

Ascanius had had enough of this mans boasts
and threats He pulled his horsehair bowstring
to its tautest point and stood aiming his arrow
beseeching Jupiter with many prayers
Almighty Jove approve my daring act
Ill bring offerings to your temple every year
and Ill set a snowy calf before your altar
Hell hold his gilded forehead as high as his mothers
butting with his horns and pawing at the sand
630 The Father heard He thundered on the left
in the cloudless sky The deadly bowstring twanged
A taut arrow sprang out hissing horribly
and pierced Remuluss head driving through
the hollow temples with its iron Ascanius
said curtly Now use haughty words to mock our courage
Heres how twicebeaten Phrygians answer you
The Trojans shouted gladly their spirits soared skyhigh
It happened that longhaired Apollo seated on
a lofty cloud was watching the Italian army
640 and the camp He said to the victor Ilus
Bravo my son Your first brave deed the pathway
to the stars Born of gods youll father gods
Under Assaracus race all wars will cease
its fated Troy will be eclipsed He sprang down
from the heights of heaven parting airy winds
and found Ascanius First he took on aged
Butes face a man whod been the armorbearer
for Anchises long ago a trusty guard
Aeneas gave him as a tutor to his son
650 Apollo mirrored the old man in every way
290

his voice and color white hair jangling armor
He said to Ilus who was hot for battle
Its enough Aeneas son that you shot
Numanus with impunity Great Apollo
grants you this first glory Hes not jealous
that you too use a bow But avoid the rest
of battle He spoke and shed his human form
slipping from their mortal eyes into thin air
The Trojan leaders knew the god and his immortal
660 weapons they heard his quiver clatter as he flew
At Apollos words and will they restrained
Ascanius who hungered for the fight The rest
returned to battle and the open risk of death
The clamor rang along the walls and towers
as they drew their bows and whirled their slings
All the ground was strewn with spears their shields
and hollow helmets clashed and clanged The fighting
surged like rain out of the west lashing earth
when watery Auriga rises like a storm
670 that pelts thick hail into the waves when south winds
freeze the rain and burst the hollow clouds
Pandarus and Bitias Alcanors sons
whom the nymph Iaera reared in Joves groves
men tall as pinetrees on their native hills
threw open the gate they guarded trusting
to their swords inviting in the enemy
They stood like towers to the right and left
armed in iron high plumes rippling on their heads
like twin oaks soaring to the sky by clear waters
680 on Pos banks or near pleasant Athesis
291

raising their unshorn heads to heaven the tall
crowns bob up and down The Rutulians
saw the open gates and charged at once
But their menled by Quercens and
Aquiculus handsome in his armor reckless
Tmarus and Haemon son of Marsall died
at the very gates or turned to run
Now rage surged in both sides hating hearts
The Trojans massed together daring combat
690 hand to hand and sallying beyond the gate
As he rampaged elsewhere causing chaos Turnus
heard the news a fever for fresh slaughter gripped
the enemy theyd put their open gates on show
He stopped what hed begun Wild rage drove him
to the gates where the proud brothers stood
First he speared Antiphates fighting at
the front Sarpedons bastard by a Theban
mother The shaft of native cornel flew through
the thin air and speared him in the stomach
700 just under his chest The gaping hole spewed out
a bloody froth the iron grew warm inside his lung
Then Turnus slaughtered Erymas and Merops
and Aphidnus Bitias died next roaring
his eyes blazing But not by a spear hed never
die by spear A shrieking Saguntine pike
sped his way like lightning The shield of two bullshides
the trusty breastplate with its double golden scales
couldnt block it His huge body crumpled falling
to the groaning earth the giant shield crashed
710 above himlike the shore at Baiae when
292

a pier of giant rocks collapses in the sea
crashing in a pile of wreckage as it hits
the shallow bottom making the sea churn Black sand
swirls up and nearby islands tremble at the sound
soaring Prochtya and Inarime a hard bed
piled on Typhoeus by Jupiters command
Now Mars lord of war gave strength and courage
to the Latins twisting his sharp spurs inside
their chests dealing Flight and black Fear to the Trojans
720 Latins swarmed from all around to seize
their chance The god of battle goaded them
Pandarus saw his brothers corpse saw how
their fortune stood how disaster drove the day
He pushed against the gate with massive shoulders
and strained to turn it on its hinges stranding many
of his men beyond the walls in bitter war
The rest he shut in with him as they bolted through
the fool who didnt realize the Rutulian king
was in the crowd and locked him in the city
730 like a hulking tiger among helpless sheep
Fresh fire flashed in Turnus eyes and his weapons
rang out horribly His helmets bloodred plumes shook
lightning glimmered from his shield Shocked
Aeneas men saw suddenly that hated face
that massive frame Huge Pandarus leapt in front
boiling with rage at his brothers death He shouted
This is not your promised dowry queen Amatas
palace These are not the coddling walls of your
town Ardea Its a hostile campyoure trapped
740 Turnus smiled at him and answered calmly Come then
293

if your heart has any courage fight with me
tell Priam you found Achilles here too
Pandarus threw his spear rough with whorls
and bark with all his strength But the breezes took it
and Saturnian Juno bent away the wound
it brought The shaft stuck in the gate and Turnus cried
You wont escape this weapon nor the power thats
behind it The man who throws it gives no second chances
Rearing high he raised his sword and halved Pandarus
750 head right down the center with the blade The temples
and smooth cheeks were sliced in two a monstrous wound
With a thud that massive weight crashed to the ground
In death he spilled onto the dirt his fallen body
and the armor dripping brains His head
split down the middle hung over each shoulder
Terrified the Trojans turned and scattered
and if the victor had thought then to smash
the locks and let his allies in that would
have been the end of warand of the Trojans
760 But frenzy and an insane lust for slaughter drove him
blazing at his enemies Phaleris
was killed Gyges hamstrings cut He seized
spears and hurled them at the fleeing Trojans
Juno gave him bravery and strength then sent
Halys to the dead then Phegeus his shield
pierced then Halius Alcander Nomon
and Prytanis caught off guard as they cheered
men from the walls Lynceus attacked calling
on his friends but by the righthand rampart Turnus
770 slashed him first one strike of his flashing sword
294

His severed head and helmet landed far away
Next fell Amycus slayer of beasts best at
smearing arrowtips and arming spears with poison
and Clytius Aeolus son and Cretheus
the Muses friend and follower who always loved
the lyre and songs and setting verse to music
he always sang of horses war battles and men
At last the Trojan leaders heard news of the bloodbath
Fierce Serestus and Mnestheus both ran up
780 to see the Trojans scattered the enemy inside
Mnestheus shouted Are you running But where to
What other walls or camps do you have Citizens
will a single man fenced in by your ramparts
deal death through our quarters unopposed
and send the best of our young men to Orcus
Cowards Wheres your shame and pity for your
suffering land your ancient gods and great Aeneas
These words fired them with courage They joined up
to hold the line Meanwhile Turnus edged back from
790 the fighting aiming for a spot next to the river
Now the Trojans fell on him more fiercely
massing round him with loud yellslike a band
of hunters cornering a savage lion with spears
Hes afraid but hate is in his eyes as he
retreats Rage and nerve wont let him turn his back
he longs to spring but balks at men and weapons
So Turnus fell back slowly hesitating
his mind seething with rage Twice he charged
into their ranks disrupting them and pushed
295

800 the Trojans back against the walls but they

quickly regrouped from the borders of the camp
Juno Saturns daughter didnt dare supply him
strength since Jupiter had sent down Iris
from the sky to pass on his harsh threats
if Turnus didnt leave the Trojan camp
The fighter couldnt hold his ground with shield
or sword The spears heaped on him from every side
engulfed him and his helmet rang around his head
with constant clangs Flying stones had broken its hard
810 bronze and the crest had been knocked off His shield
couldnt stop the blows Now thundering Mnestheus
and the Trojan soldiers multiplied the rain
of spears His whole body ran with grimy streams
of sweat He couldnt breathe and shook with gasps
At last he leapt into the river plunging in
headfirst with his armor Its sandy currents welcomed
him and buoyed him with gentle waves Rinsing
off the blood it sent him happy to his friends

296

BOOK 10


Now great Olympus palace was flung open
The father of the gods and king of men convened
a council in that starry home from whose heights
he saw all lands the Trojan camps and Latin peoples
When all were seated in the hall with double doors
he began Great skygods why this change
of heart this bitter disagreement My command
was that the Trojans and Italians should not fight
Whats this conflict then What fear caused
10 each side to take to war and weapons The time
for fighting will arrive dont hasten it
when fierce Carthage opens up the Alps
to launch destruction on Romes citadel
Then they can compete in hate and pillage
For now stop Be allies gladly as agreed
Jupiter spoke briefly but golden Venuss
response was far from brief Father eternal
king of mankind and the world entire
who else could I appeal to now Dont you see
20 how proudly the Rutulians strut how boldly
Turnus gallops through the ranks puffed up by

297

fresh victory The Trojan camp no longer
offers safety The fights within the very walls
and ramparts the trenches overflow with blood
Aeneas is away and doesnt know Will you
never let the siege be raised Again
an army menaces the walls of a new Troy
again Diomedes will attack the Trojans
from Greek Arpi No doubt new wounds await me too
30 your daughter still harassed by human swords
If the Trojans came to Italy against
your will let them expiate their error
withhold your help But if they followed many
oracles from gods and ghosts how could anyone
overturn your orders now and alter fate
Must I mention ships ablaze at Eryx
the raging storms freed by the King of Winds
or Iris on a mission from the clouds
Now Juno even meddles with the dead
40 the only realm she hadnt touchedsuddenly
Allecto runs amok in the Italian towns
I no longer care for empires I just had hope
while my luck stood Your favorites can win
If theres no land your heartless wife will give
the Trojans I beg you by Troys smoking ruins
let me take Ascanius away from war
unharmed Allow my grandson to survive
Aeneas can be tossed on unknown seas
following whatever path Fate gives
50 Just let me save the boy from battles terrors
I control Amathus Cythera high Paphus
and a shrine in Cyprus let him drop his sword
298

and lead an unheroic life there Tell Carthage
to subdue Ausonia Tyrian towns
can rise unhampered What use was surviving
in a fatal war surrounded by Greek flames
and endless risks on land and sea if they still lack
their Latium their second Pergamum
Better if theyd settled on the ashes
60 of their fatherland the soil that was Troy
Father give back Simos and Xanthus
let these wretched people live Troys fate again
Now deep rage stung Juno Why am I being forced
to shatter my long silence and lay bare old wounds
Which god or man compelled Aeneas to choose war
and make an enemy of King Latinus
Fine he came to Italy guided by fate
or forced by mad Cassandra did I urge
him to leave his camp and trust his life to winds
70 To put his son in charge rely on walls
rile up Tuscan loyalties and peaceful clans
Which god drove him to deceit What harshness
of mine Wheres Juno here or Iris from the sky
If its dreadful that Italians circled
a new Troy with flames or that Turnus divine
Venilias son Pilumnus heir has made a stand
on his own land what about the Trojans torching
Latium seizing foreign fields and plunder
Or choosing inlaws stealing fiances seeking
80 peace with words while fixing shields on prows
It was fine for you to snatch Aeneas from the
Greeks to hide him in a hollow puff of cloud
299

to turn a whole fleet into just as many nymphs
but its an outrage if Ive aided the Rutulians
Aeneas is away and doesnt know So what
You own Paphus Cyprus lofty Cythera
Why attack fierce hearts and burden towns with war
Am I trying to topple Troys unsteady rule
Who threw the wretched Phrygians to the Greeks
90 Europe and Asia rose in war and broke
their treatywhy Who stole a woman Was it
I who made the Trojan cheater storm and
capture Sparta did I arm a lovers war
Your concern was due back then Its too late now
for empty slander and unfair complaints
So Juno pled her case All the skygods murmured
in favor of one goddess or the other like the
early rustling of winds caught in forestsa hidden
murmur warning sailors of the storms to come
100 Then the almighty father ruler of all things
began to speak The gods high home fell silent
the soil trembled underfoot The heavens stilled
the breezes died the ocean waters settled
Listen and take my words to heart Since Troy
and Italy were not permitted to make peace
and your quarrel knows no end today
I wont distinguish Trojans from Rutulians
no matter what their luck or what their hopes
whether its the fate of Italy thats caused
110 this siege or Trojan error and vicious advice
The Rutulians are not absolved Each side
will bear the consequence of their acts
300

Royal Jove is neutral the fates will find their way
He swore this by his brothers Stygian streams
the banks bubbling with pitch and the dark abyss
Olympus staggered with his nod all talk was done
The gods saw him from his gold throne to the door
Meanwhile the Rutulians crowded all the gates
keen to kill their enemies and ring the camp
120 with flames Aeneas troops were trapped inside the walls
with no hope of escape Wretched they stood
on the towers uselessly Two Assarici
Asius Imbrasus son and Thymoetes
son to Hicetaon took the front positions
with Castor and old Thymbris the ramparts sparse defense
Also Sarpedons brothers from great Lycia
Clarus and Thaemon Acmon of Lyrnesus
huge as his father Clytius or brother Menestheus
hoisted a huge boulder the good part of a hill
130 with great effort Some tried to save the camp
with spears some with stones and fire and arrows
Among them was the Trojan boy Venus
special care his noble head uncovered
He shone like a jewel set in yellow gold
a gem for neck or brow or like bright ivory
set skillfully in terebinth or boxwood
His hair spilled down his milky neck over
the circling choker of soft gold You too
Ismarus your greatsouled people saw you
140 aiming shots arrows that youd armed with poison
noble son of Lydia where farmers plow
rich fields watered with Pactoluss gold dust
301

Mnestheus was there too raised skyhigh by glory
from the day before when hed beaten Turnus
from the walls and Capys whod name Capua
So they fought in the bitter strife of war
But in the dead of night Aeneas left Evander
sailing for the camp of the Etruscan king
He explained his name and race his needs and
150 assets and pled with him warning that
Mezentius was gaining allies Turnus called for
violence and his own plans might someday
fall apart At once Tarchon struck a pact
and gave him men paying Lydias debt
to gods and fate They sailed with a foreigner
as leader Aeneas was in front his ships beak
carved with Phrygian lions in Mount Idas
shadow a sweet sight for Trojan exiles
He sat there thinking of the varied phases
160 of the war Close at his left Pallas asked
about the stars their guides through the inky night
then about his sufferings on land and sea
Muses open Helicon inspire my song
Tell me of the troops Aeneas took from Tuscan
shores to man the ships and sail the sea
Massicus led His bronze ship Tiger cut the waves
a thousand of his men on board Theyd left
walled Clusium and Cosae land of arrows
lightweight quivers and bows dealing death
170 With him was grim Abas his men in striking
302

armor a gold Apollo gleaming on his stern
His native Populonia had given him
six hundred veterans The island Ilva dotted
with rich iron mines sent three hundred more
In third place was Asilas seer of men and gods
He read bulls entrails and the stars above
the speech of birds and lightnings fiery omens He brought
a thousand men thickset ranks of bristling spears
Pisa Tuscan offshoot of Alphean Pisa
180 sent them to follow him Then came handsome
Astyr trusting in his horse and varicolored
armor Three hundred more were sent all keen
to join from round the river Minio and Caere
from ancient Pyrgi and Graviscae land of fevers
Cunarus bravest leader of the Lydians
I wont pass you by nor you Cupavo followed
by a few Your helmets swanplumes honored Cycnus
your father changed into a swan by Venus and
her son They say he mourned his lover Phathon
190 under leafy poplars that were once his sisters
finding comfort for grief in the Muse of song
As he sang he grew the downy plumes of white
old age left the earth and soared up to the stars
His son drove forward the huge Centaur leading
young men like himself Its halfhorse figurehead
loomed high above threatening to throw a rock
into the waves The long keel plowed deep ocean
Ocnus mustered soldiers from his native banks
son of the seer Manto and the Tuscan river
303

200 He gave Mantua walls and his mothers name

Mantua rich in different ancestors
a city with three races and four clans in each
Her strength came from Tuscan blood Here hatred
for Mezentius propelled five hundred into
war The river Mincius Benacus son
was their warships figurehead veiled in graygreen
reeds Next Aulestes led the heavy Triton
a hundred oars rising to thrash the waves
and roil the marble surface of the sea
210 Tritons statue scared the blue sea with his conch
to his waist a hairy man a fish below
Waves churned and roared under the hybrids chest
So many chosen princes came on thirty ships
to fight for Troy Their bronze beaks cut the briny plains
Now day had slipped from sky and kindly Phoebe
trampled high Olympus with her nightly horses
Aeneas since his cares gave him no rest
held the helm himself tending to the sails
Suddenly far out to sea a band of friends
220 appeared the nymphs whom kind Cybele
had changed from ships into seagoddesses
A line of them cut through the waves a number
equal to the prows that once were moored at shore
They recognized the king from far and circled him
in dance Cymodocea most skilled in speech
held the stern with one hand paddling softly under
water with the other rising from the surface
She asked confused Aeneas Are you keeping watch
Aeneas born of gods Wake up let out the sails
304

230 Were the pines from Idas sacred peak once

your fleetnow ocean nymphs When lying Turnus
rushed at us with flames and swords we broke your ropes
unwillingly Now we search for you at sea
since Cybele pitied us and changed our form
she made us goddesses that live under the waves
Young Ascanius is trapped by walls and trenches
besieged by spears and Latins barbed for war
Arcadian horsemen hold their posts along with strong
Etruscans But Turnus plans to send his central column
240 to stop their union with the Trojan camp
Rise with the dawn and quickly call your men
to arms Take the deathless shield the Fire God
himself ringed with gold and gave to you
If you trust my words tomorrows sun will see
huge heaps of dead Rutulians As she left
she pushed the high stern with her hand she knew
the ways of boats The ship flew across the waves
quicker than a spear or windswift arrow
The whole fleet sped up too Anchises Trojan son
250 baffled awestruck took heart at the omen
Gazing at the vault of sky he briefly prayed
Kind Cybele mother of the gods to whom
Mount Dindyma and towered towns and harnessed
lions are dear guide me now in battle make this
omen good and help your Trojans goddess
The full light of the wheeling day was rushing in
to rout the night already Right away
Aeneas told his troops to rally round
the standards and to brace their hearts for war

305

260 And now as he stood on the high stern he spied

the Trojans and their camp He raised his blazing shield
The soldiers on the wall raised a warshout
to the stars fresh hope spurred their rage
Their spears flewlike cranes leaving the river Strymon
under stormclouds honking as they skim the air
raucous with delight at fleeing the south wind
The Italian chiefs and Turnus were surprised
until they turned to see a fleet nearing the shore
a massive flood of ships converging on them
270 Aeneas helmet flashed a flame poured from its crest
and his shields golden boss shot fire
like a glowing comets bloodred tail deathly
in the clear night or scorching Sirius
bringer of disease and drought to feeble mortals
souring the night sky with unlucky light
Yet bold Turnus was no less convinced
that he could hold the shore and block the ships
He raised his mens spiritsand added a rebuke
You have your wishto break the Trojans strength
280 The god of battles in your hands Remember now
your wives and homes the great deeds of the past
and our fathers glory Lets catch them on the beach
while theyre afraid while their first steps totter
on the gangways Fortune helps the brave
He decided whom to take with him to fight
and whom to trust with the blockaded camp
Meanwhile Aeneas soldiers disembarked from
the high ships Many waited for the surf
306

to ebb and weaken then leapt into shallow water
290 others rowed Tarchon scouted out the shore
avoiding shoals where breaking waves crashed loudly
seeing where swells gently lapped the land
He quickly pointed his prow there and asked the crew
Bend to oars my chosen band drive
your boats ahead let the ships beaks gouge
this hostile land let your keels furrow it
No matter if this mooring breaks our fleet apart
as long as we make land Tarchon spoke
his crews surged to the oars They drove the foamflecked
300 ships onto the Latin shore until the beaks
were rammed into dry earth and the keels
were beached and safeTarchon all but yours
which smashed into the shoals For a while it tilted
back and forth wedged on a jutting sandbar battered
by the waves then broke The crew spilled out into
the seahampered by the splintered oars and floating
benches and an ebbtow pulling at their feet
No hesitation held back fierce Turnus He threw
his front line at the Trojans All clashed on the shore
310 The bugles sang Aeneas was the first to wade
into the throng of farmers a good omen
cutting Latins down killing giant Theron
as he charged His sword sliced Therons goldscaled
tunic and the chain mail made of bronze
It gashed his flank and drank his blood Lichas was next
sacred to Apollo cut from his dead mother
The child escaped the bladebut to what end
Soon he killed hard Cisseus and massive Gyas
307

as they clubbed the hordes Herculess weapon
320 didnt help nor strong hands nor their father
Melampus Alcides friend while earth served him
hard tasks As Pharus boasted uselessly
a whirling spear wedged in his blabbing mouth
You too luckless Cydon youd have fallen
by that Trojan hand as you trailed Clytius
your new passion Youd be free of your eternal
love of boys as you lay there pitiful
But your brothers Phorcus sons stopped Aeneas
seven sons with seven hurtling spears
330 Some glanced off his shield and helmet uselessly
some kind Venus turned aside so they only
grazed him Aeneas called to loyal Achates
Bring the spears we pulled from Greeks I killed
at Troy Not one I throw at the Rutulians
will miss its mark Grabbing a huge shaft
he let it fly It pierced Maeons shield of bronze
ripping open chest and breastplate in one go
His brother Alcanor rushed up to catch him
stretching out his hands but a spear severed
340 his right arm and kept on flying trailing blood
the dead limb dangled from the shoulder by the sinews
Another brother Numitor wrenched the spear
from Maeons corpse but failed to strike Aeneas
with it He merely grazed mighty Achates thigh
Now Clausus of Cures bold in his young strength
hurled a spear that hit Dryops in midsentence
It entered below the chin and tore his throat
stripping him of voice and life together He retched
308

thick blood and fell his forehead thudding on the earth
350 Next Clausus killed three Thracians of Boreas noble
race then three men from Ismara sent by their
father Idasdifferent deaths for each Halaesus
and a party of Auruncans charged with Neptunes
famous son Messapus who excelled with horses
One side then the other tried to rout
the enemy right at Italys doorstep Like winds
fighting in the sky as they clash with equal
force and spiritnot one yields nor will the clouds
and sea the battles balanced in a violent lock
360 so the Trojan ranks clashed with the Latin
feet treading on feet men crushing men
Elsewhere a stream in flood had strewn the ground
with tumbled rocks and trees torn from its banks
The rugged wet terrain forced Pallas horsemen
to dismount and they fled before a Latin
charge unused to being on foot When Pallas saw
he summoned despairs last resort and fired
their bravery with pleas and bitter words
Youre retreating friends To where By your brave acts
370 by King Evanders name by wars youve won
by my hopes to match my fathers fame dont trust
this path Our swords must slash a passage through
their ranks Your noble country calls you
to the thick of battle and me with you
The gods are not against us were humans chased by
humans We all have one soul two hands Look
Ocean circles us an endless obstacle
Lands gone Will you pick the Trojan camp or sea
309

He spoke and charged at the packed enemy
380 A cruel fate drew Lagus to confront him first

As he tried to hoist a massive boulder Pallas
pierced him with his whirling spear where the ribs
meet spine Pallas worked to free the shaft stuck in
the bone and Hisbo hoped to catch him bending
and off guard But Hisbos fury at his friends
cruel death distracted him Pallas was quicker
He plunged his sword in Hisbos rageful lungs
Next was Sthenius then Anchemolus Rhoeteus
kin whod dared seduce his fathers wife

390 You too twins Larides and Thymber Daucus sons

each others mirror fell in the Rutulian fields
once a source of sweet confusion to your parents
But Pallas gave you now a cruel distinction
Evanders swordblade hacked off Thymbers head
while Laridus lopped hand searched for its arm
the dying fingers spasming on the hilt
The sight of Pallas dazzling acts and angry shame
at his rebuke armed the Arcadians anew
Now Pallas pierced Rhoeteus as his chariot
400 sped past This gave space and time to Ilus
whod been the distant target of that heavy spear
Rhoeteus had been on the run from Teuthras and his
brother Tyres As he died he dangled from his
chariot his heels hitting Rutulian soil
Like fires that a shepherd lights in summer at first
310

spaced through the woods then as hoped the winds
arise and light the gaps so a single jagged
burning line extends across broad fields he sits
and gazes at the dancing flames in triumphlike this
410 his courageous comrades now united to help
Pallas Then Halaesus fierce fighter charged them
huddling in his shields shelter He killed Ladon
Pheres and Demodocus and lopped off
Strymonius right hand with his gleaming blade
as it grabbed his throat Then he took a rock
and bashed in Thoas face spraying bone and blood
and brain Halaesus father knowing fate once hid him
in the woods but when death closed the fathers clouded
eyes the Fates seized his son and sacrificed him
420 to Evanders spear Pallas rushed him praying
Father Tiber give my spear good luck
and a path through hard Halaesus chest
Your oak will get his armor and his spoils The god
heard While poor Halaesus shielded Imaon
Pallas spear found his unprotected chest
But Lausus no small part of battle wouldnt let
the scope of Pallas slaughter terrify the troops
First he butchered Abas that bulwark of war
Then Etruscans died and Arcadias prime
430 and Trojan soldiers whod survived the Greeks
The front lines clashed matched in strength and leaders
The rear guard crowded them and the crush
hampered their hands and swords On one side
Pallas urged them on on the other Lausus
These two were close in age both handsome both
311

robbed of homecoming by fate But the king of
high Olympus didnt let them face each other
A greater adversary would soon seal their fate
Kind Juturna Turnus sister urged him to help
440 Lausus He cut through the lines with his swift chariot
When he saw his men he shouted Stop the fighting
Its for me to confront Pallas Pallas is mine
I just wish his father could be here to see
The men cleared the field as told When they left
young Pallas amazed by the proud command
stared at Turnus from afar and rolled his
fierce gaze across the mans great frame
This was his retort to the kings words
Ill win glory either way by taking your rich
450 spoils or by a splendid death My fathers
fine with both Enough of threats He walked into
the open Blood froze in Arcadian hearts
Turnus leapt down from his chariot ready
for close combat He came on like a lion
who spies a distant bull snorting for war
from his high overlook and flies down for the kill
When Pallas thought his spear could reach Turnus
he ran forward hoping bravery would help
this mismatched duel praying to the great sky
460 I beg you Hercules by my fathers welcome
his feast for a stranger help this great attempt
Let Turnus see me ripping off his bloody armor
as he dies let his dimming eyes fall on
his victor Alcides heard and stifled a great
groan within his heart shedding futile tears
312

Jove his father spoke kind words to him The day
of death awaits all men their time is brief and comes
just once But they can prolong their fame by action
This is the task of valor Many sons of gods
470 were killed by Troys high walls my son Sarpedon died
among them Turnus too is called by fate
The finish line of his allotted life is near
Jove spoke and turned his eyes from the Rutulian fields
Pallas flung his spear forcefully then pulled
his gleaming sword out of its sheath The spear
flew and hit the shields high rim next to
Turnus shoulder forcing a path through
Now even that huge body felt a graze Turnus
aimed his spear with its sharp iron tip at Pallas
480 brandished it at length and shouted See if
my spear penetrates a little better
The quivering shaft ran through the center of the shield
through so many bronze and iron layers
so many folds of overlapping bullhide It pierced
Pallas breastplate boring into that great chest
He tore the warm spear from the woundit didnt help
As his soul and lifeblood spurted from that hole
together he collapsed in his own blood His weapons
clattered and he hit his bloody mouth on the
490 hard earth Turnus towered over him and said
Arcadians remember this and tell Evander
I return the Pallas he deserves Ill grant
whatever honors in a grave whatever solace
comes from burial But being Aeneas host
will not have proven cheap Bracing his left foot
313

against the corpse he ripped away the massive weight
of Pallas swordbelt carved to show a wicked crime
a band of husbands murdered in their bloody beds
on a single wedding night worked by Clonus
500 with much gold Turnus reveled in the spoils
hed won How blind the minds of men to fate
and future to minding limits even in good luck
Thered come a time when Turnus would wish
hed left Pallas untouched Hed hate this day these spoils
But a crowd of Pallas friends with many groans
and tears set him on his shield and took him home
Ah Pallas youll bring grief and glory to your father
You entered war and left it the same day but still
you left behind huge heaps of the Rutulian dead
510 A heraldno mere rumor of disasterflew

to tell Aeneas his men were at the edge of death
it was time to help the routed Trojans Aeneas
mowed down those around him slashing a wide pathway
through the fighters on fire hunting you Turnus
so proud of your fresh kill In his mind
he saw young Pallas and Evander their feast
for a stranger and the pledge theyd made
He took four of Sulmos sons alive
and four that Ufens raised to offer to Hells shades
520 Theyd splatter Pallas pyre with captive blood
Then from far he hurled his deadly spear at Magus
who had the wit to duck the shaft as it flew over
He clasped Aeneas knees in supplication
I beg you by your fathers ghost your hopes in Ilus
as he grows spare me for my son and father
314

Buried deeply in my noble home are bars
of engraved silver and gold ingots some carved
some natural The Trojan victory doesnt turn
on this a single soul wont matter much
530 Aeneas countered with these words The many
bars of gold and silver that you speak of
keep them for your sons Turnus ended
barter in war when he murdered Pallas So say
Ilus and the ghost of my father Anchises
Gripping Magus helmet in his hand he bent
his neck back as he begged and pushed in the sword
Haemons son was nearby priest of Diana and
Apollo his head bound with sacred ribbons
gleaming in white emblems and white robes
540 He fled across the field but fell Aeneas
killed him and Deaths mighty darkness cloaked him
Serestus carried back the armor as Mars trophy
Caeculus of Vulcans line and Umbro
from the Marsian hills rallied the men
The Trojan raged against them Hed already
lopped off Anxurs left arm with his sword
the shield falling with it Anxur had made wild boasts
and thought his strength would back them Perhaps he dreamed
of fame reaching the stars and white old age
550 Tarquitus the son of sylvan Faunus and the
nymph Dryope showing off his gleaming armor
blocked Aeneas blazing path The Trojan pinned
Tarquitus shield to his breastplate with a spear
and struck his head off as he begged in vain
searching for more words Rolling over
315

the warm trunk Aeneas said with hatred
Lie there now and scare us No dear mother
will bury you in earth or pile a tomb on you
Youll be left to vultures or the sea will take
560 your sodden corpse hungry fish will suck your wounds
Then he chased down Turnus vanguard Lucas and
Antaeus and brave Numa and blond Camers son of
greatsouled Volcens richest landowner among
Ausonians the king of quiet Amyclae
As blood warmed his sword Aeneas stormed
across the plain in triumph like Aegaeon
said to have a hundred arms a hundred hands
and fifty firebreathing mouths and chests
when he clashed against Joves lightning bolts
570 he had fifty shields and swords Now he rushed
Niphaeus fourhorse chariot as it approached
But the horses saw his giant strides and heard
his awful warcry They shied and bolted spilling out
Niphaeus and dragged the chariot to shore
Lucagus drawn by two white horses charged Aeneas
His brother Liger held the reins and steered
as Lucagus fiercely waved his unsheathed blade
Aeneas could not tolerate this hotheaded
onrush Huge holding his spear he ran to face them
580 Liger shouted These are not the horses
of Diomedes You dont see Achilles
chariot or the Phrygian plains Your life
and the war end here So the fool yapped loudly
He received no answer As Lucagus bent
to goad the horses with his sword bracing
316

for the fight by planting forward his left leg
Aeneas hurled his spear It came tearing
through the bright shields lowest rim and ripped
through his left thigh He tumbled from the chariot
590 writhing on the ground as death came over him
Pious Aeneas spoke these bitter words
Lucagus your chariot was not betrayed
by skittish horses shying at mere shadows
you leapt from the wheels and abandoned it
He seized the harness Wretched Liger held out
helpless handshed fallen from the chariot too
I beg you by the parents who raised such a son
Trojan hero let me live pity my prayers
But Aeneas said to these frantic pleas Thats not
600 how you spoke just now Be loyal to your brother
Die He opened up his chest the souls dark home
Such was the slaughter that Aeneas dealt across
the fields raging like a torrent or black
whirlwind At last his son Ascanius and
the men broke free of camp The siege had failed
Jupiter now came to talk to Juno Sister
and most darling wife as well as you thought
and you were right Venus is behind the Trojans
strengthnot just their hands so tireless in war
610 not just their fierce souls inured to danger
Juno meekly answered Best of husbands why
torment a feeble wife who fears your rebukes
If my love had the force it used to once
and ought to still you who are allpowerful
would let me carry Turnus from the battle
317

and keep him unscathed for his father Daunus
But fine let him die and pay the Trojans
with his pious blood And yet hes one of ours
since Pilumnus was his ancestor Turnus
620 has often heaped your shrine with lavish gifts
The king of high Olympus answered briefly
If you seek some time for your doomed prince
by a stay of death and you accept my terms
then rescue Turnus snatch him from Fates tightening
noose this much is allowed But if some greater
favor lurks under your plea if you want
the whole war changed you feed on empty hopes
At this Juno wept Why cant you give me what
your words withhold why cant Turnus have his life
630 Unless Im wrong an awful death awaits
a blameless man How I wish false fear toyed
with me and youd change your plansyou can
She spoke and swooped down from the sky through
the breezes wrapped in mist bringing storms
She reached the Trojan army and Laurentian camp
Then she formed a weak and wraithlike shadow
from filmy cloud to be Aeneas lookalike
a marvel She gave it Trojan armor Aeneas shield
the plumes over that godly head his gait
640 and hollow words sounds without a meaning
like phantoms said to hover after death
or visions that deceive our sleeping senses
The image pranced before the front lines happily
taunting Turnus with rude shouts flaunting weapons
Turnus attacked throwing his hissing spear
318

from afar The shadow turned and ran
Turnus thought the real Aeneas had turned tail
In confusion he clung to that empty thought
Where do you run Aeneas Dont desert the wedding
650 My blade will put you in the land for which youve sailed
the seas He chased him with such shouts waving his drawn
sword blind to how the winds dispersed his triumph
The ship of King Osinius from Clusium
happened to be moored at a tall and rocky
outcrop its ladders and gangplank lowered Into its depths
plunged the anxious phantom of Aeneas
on the run but Turnus just as quick was at
its heels not pausing once He leapt over the ramp
But hed hardly reached the prow when Juno broke
660 the hawser and the current whisked the boat away
The flimsy shade no longer tried to hide
but flew up and merged with the dark clouds
On land Aeneas called Turnus out to fight Looking
for the missing man he sent many down to death
as a stormwind carried Turnus out to sea
Confused and ungrateful to be safe
he gazed back and raised his voice and hands
up to the stars Almighty Father did I merit
such disgrace Did you choose this punishment
670 Where am I going How can I return who will
I be if they think I ran Will I see
my walls again Or those who followed me to war
Have I left them to a ghastly death the horror
do I see them routed do I hear their dying
groans What should I do What pit could open
319

deep enough for me Show me pity winds
smash this boat against the rocky cliffs
Turnus begs you Drive me onto savage reefs
where no Rutulian can follow nor my shame
680 And now he wavered first this way then that
should he fall upon his sword mad with
his disgrace and drive the raw blade through his ribs
or throw himself into the waves to strike out
for the curving shore and Trojans spears again
He tried both paths three times three times great Juno
held him back taking pity on him Fair winds
and favoring tides carried the boat It cut the waves
and reached his father Daunus ancient city
But now fiery Mezentius joined the fight
690 at Joves command As he charged the joyful Trojans
Etruscan ranks surrounded him raining
hatred and their weapons on a single man
He was like a headland jutting out to sea
facing the winds fury exposed to the waves
bearing all the raging threats of sky and sea
unmoved He hacked down Hebrus Dolichaons son
and with him Latagus and Palmus as he turned
to run He smashed Latagus face with a rock
torn from the cliff then sliced through Palmus hamstrings
700 leaving him writhing weakly He gave Lausus
Palmus armor and his crest to wear Next fell
Trojan Evanthes then Paris friend and agemate
Mimas son of Amycus and Theano
born the night Queen Hecuba had Paris
she was pregnant with Troys future flames
320

Paris lies in his paternal city but Mimas
sprawls unknown on the Laurentian shore
Like a boar protected many years
by Vesuluss pines or the Laurentian swamps
710 reed forestonce chased from the heights by snapping dogs
and trapped in nets it takes a stand snorting rage
hackles raised and no one dares to make the kill
men attack with shouts and spears safely distant
while it slowly circles to attack fearless
gnashing teeth shaking spears off its back
just so all the soldiers justly angry
at Mezentius didnt dare close combat
They harried him from far with spears and shouting
A Greek named Acron had arrived from ancient
720 Corythus an exile his marriage unfulfilled
Far off Mezentius saw him in the thick of battle
wearing purple clothes the gift of his betrothed
Like an unfed lion prowling through high lairs
driven mad by hunger happy if he sees
a fleeing goat or young buck breaking in his horns
then he crouches huge jaws gaping mane on end
feeding on the entrails letting stinking gore
rinse out his cruel mouththis was swift
Mezentius pouncing on the crowded ranks
730 He hit unlucky Acron whose heels beat on
black earth the bloodied spear snapped by his fall
But he didnt deign to kill Orodes as he
fled or inflict a spear wound from behind
He ran to face him man to man a better
victory without stealth Bracing his foot
321

on the corpse he pulled hard on his spear and cried
Men here lies Orodes a bastion of war
His friends took up his glad refrain But the
victim gasped last words Vengeance will come
740 stranger You wont rejoice long For you as well
an equal fate awaits Soon these fields will hold you
Mezentius smiled thinly through his rage Die now
The father of the gods and king of men will see
to me He yanked the spear from the body
Bleak rest and iron sleep weighed down Orodes eyes
Their light was quenched for an eternal night
Caedicus killed Alcathos Sacrator
killed Hydaspes Rapo killed Parthenius
and strong Orses Messapus killed Clonius
750 and Erichaetes one thrown from his bareback horse
one on foot Lycian Agis came up just to
fall to Valerus brave as his ancestors
Salius killed Thronius but Nealces
got him His stealthy longrange arrows were wellknown
Now grim Mars dealt death and sorrow equally
They killed and died alike victors and their
victims Neither side would think to yield
The gods in Joves high halls felt pity for this pointless
rage the awful suffering of mortals
760 Here sat Venus and there Juno looking on as
pale Tisiphone ran riot among thousands
And now stormy Mezentius shaking his great
spear advanced across the field towering like
322

Orion when he walks on foot along
the oceans awesome depths shoulderhigh to waves
or hauls an ancient ash tree down the mountain
his feet on the ground his head lost in the clouds
So Mezentius rushed on with fearsome weapons
Aeneas spied him in the enemys front line
770 and closed in for the combat Unperturbed and steadfast
Mezentius waited for the greatsouled fighter
measuring how far his spear could fly Right hand
he said youre my only god Help me now
and you the spear I throw Lausus I swear youll wear
the spoils I rip from this pirates corpseyoull be
the token of my victory He threw his hissing
spear But it angled off Aeneas shield
and struck noble Antores Herculess friend
from Argos in the side This man had joined Evander
780 and settled in a local town Poor wretch he died
from a wound not meant for him as he looked up
at the sky and thought of lovely Argos
Then pious Aeneas threw his spear It pierced
the concave shield of three bronze layers linen
folds and three bullshides lodging near
Mezentius groinbut its flight stopped there
The sight of Tuscan blood gladdened Aeneas
He grabbed his sword and furiously charged
his shaken enemy But Lausus saw and groaned
790 with deep love for his father shedding tears
Lausus I wont silence your memory
your hard death or your heroism if indeed
history tells the truth about your exploits
As his father turned to crawl away helpless
323

handicapped dragging his shield and Aeneas
spear his son rushed in between them parrying
Aeneas sword just as his right hand rose to strike
stopping him and fending off the blow
His friends shouted loudly throwing spears
800 and lances to repel Aeneas so the father
could retreat while shielded by his son
Aeneas furious kept under coveras when
clouds fling down a fierce hailstorm every farmer
every plowman scatters from the fields
the traveler finds shelter under riverbanks
or the arch of some high cliff while rain
batters the earth but they resume their day when
the sun returns So lashed by spears all
around Aeneas waited out the thunderhead
810 of war shouting rebukes and threats at Lausus
Why this hurry to meet death to dare whats past
your strength Your piety lures you to be rash
But Lausus pressed on the fool Fury surged up
in the Trojan and the Fates gathered the final
threads of Lausus life Aeneas drove his hard blade
through the young mans body The pointed tip went through
his shield too thin to match his threats and the tunic
that his mother wove with soft gold mesh It sank in
to the hilt Blood filled his lungs his mournful life
820 descended to the shades abandoning his body
But when Anchises son looked at his dying face
that ashen otherworldly face he groaned deeply
pitying the boy and stretched his hand to him
His own paternal piety came to his mind
324

Poor boy what can pious Aeneas give you
worthy of your bravery and noble nature
Keep the armor you so loved I return you
to the ghosts and ashes of your ancestors
if you can care Your unhappy death has one sole
830 comfort you fell to great Aeneas Rebuking Lausus
lagging friends he lifted the corpse up from
the earth as blood defiled his wellcurled hair
Meanwhile by the Tibers banks Lausus father
cleaned his wounds with water propped against a trunk
His bronze helmet dangled from a branch
the heavy armor rested on the grass
His chosen men stood round him as he gasped in pain
neck bent long beard spilling down his chest
He kept asking about Lausus he kept sending
840 men to call him at a sad fathers request
But Lausus weeping friends were bringing the corpse
on his shield a great man killed by a great wound
His father heard the groaning from far off
with terrible foreboding Defiling his white hair
with dust he stretched both hands upward and embraced
his son Did such a lust for life possess me child
that I let you take my place before the killers
sword My son did these gashes save your father
who lives thanks to your death Now at last I feel
850 the horror of my exile the depth of my wound
My son I stained your name with my own crimes
Hatred drove me from my fathers throne and rule
it was I who owed atonement to my peoples
hate the guilt was mine I should have paid by any
325

death at all I still havent left this land
this light But leave I will He got up on his injured
thigh resolute and though the deep wound sapped
his strength he called for his horse This was his pride
and comfort on it he rode a victor out of every
860 combat He spoke to the grieving animal
Rhaebus weve lived long if anything is long
in mortal terms Today youll bring back bloody spoils
and Aeneas head avenging Lausus death
with me or if our force finds no way forward
well fall together Brave beast I dont think
youd follow orders from a Trojan master
Mounting his horse he sat as he always did
and loaded both hands with sharp lances his helmet
flashing with its horsehaircrest Like this
870 he plunged into the fray his heart seething
with great shame and madness mixed with grief
And now he called Aeneas three times loudly
Aeneas knew him and was glad He prayed
May great Apollo and the father of the gods
bring this to be Start the fight He ran
to face Mezentius his spear poised
But he replied Why try to terrify me now
you savage who killed my son That was the only
way to ruin me I dont fear death or care for
880 gods Hush I come to die but first I bring you
gifts He hurled his long lance at his enemy
then another and another as he circled
him They landed but the gilded shield held them
Three times he wheeled leftward round his watching
enemy throwing lances three times the Trojan
326

hauled around the massive iron forest fixed
in his bronze shield Then sick of long delay
sick of plucking out so many lances pressed by
the unequal fight at last
890 he broke free and hurled his spear at the stallions
head The horse reared up and thrashed the air with hooves
throwing his rider Beast and man fell in a tangled
heap the horses shoulder broken From both sides
shouts set the sky on fire Aeneas flew to him
pulling out his sword and said Wheres fierce
Mezentius now and that savagery of spirit
The Tuscan looked up at the sky gulping air
and answered as he came back to himself
900 Bitter enemy why these taunts and threats
Killing mes no crime I didnt come to battle
on such terms My Lausus made no pact with you
for me I ask one thing a kindness for a fallen
enemy let my corpse be buried I know
my peoples bitter hate surrounds me block their rage
I beg you Let me lie in Lausus tomb He spoke
and took the sword into his throat knowing death
His life pumped out in bloody waves over his armor

327

BOOK 11


Meanwhile Dawn rose over Oceans rim
Aeneas grief would have him turn to burying
his friends he reeled with Pallas death Still
he paid the gods a victors vows at daybreak
On a mound he raised a huge oak stripped of branches
and dressed it in bright armorspoils he took
from Lord Mezentius to be a gift for you
great God of War a helmet crest that oozed
with blood the broken spears and battered breastplate
10 punctured in twelve places He set the bronze shield
to the trunks left side and hung the ivoryhilted
sword on top Then he rallied the triumphant
soldiers as the leaders thronged around him
Weve managed a great feat my men Let go any
fear that remains Here stand a tyrants spoils
the first fruits of war heres my Mezentius
Now we march to King Latinus walls
Draw your swords set your hearts and hopes on war
Once the gods tell us to hoist the standards
20 and march our men from camp dont be taken
by surpriseno second thoughts or fear
For now lets put the bodies of our friends

328

in earth the only glory in deep Acheron
Honor the great souls who won this country
with their blood pay their final rites But first
we must take Pallas to Evanders mourning city
The day of darkness swept him off for all
his courage and plunged him into bitter death
In tears Aeneas went back to the threshold
30 where Pallas lifeless body lay Old Acoetes
was guarding it He was once the armorbearer
for Evander then chosen as a ward for this
dear child a pairing that would prove less happy
The slaves stood round the body with the Trojan
troops and Trojan women their hair loose in mourning
And when Aeneas came through the high entrance
the women beat their chests and a great groan rose up
to the stars The royal tent rang out with grief
He saw Pallas with his head propped up his face
40 pale as snow the smooth chest gaping with its wound
from an Italian spear His tears welled again
When Fortune smiled on me poor boy was your
life the cost so youd never see our kingdom
or ride in triumph to your fathers house
This was not my promise to Evander when I
left when he sent me off with an embrace
to win a mighty empire warning me with fear
that wed fight fierce men a ruthless race
Still now perhaps beguiled by hollow hope
50 he offers vows and heaps gifts on the altar
while we sadly escort back this lifeless boy
an empty honorwho owes nothing to the gods
329

Unlucky man your childs heartrending burial
awaits Is this the glorious return we pledged
Is this my solemn promise But Evander you wont
see him with shameful wounds you wouldnt want to wish death
on a coward son O Italy youve lost
your great protector and Ilus so have you

Aeneas wept and had them lift the wretched body
60 He sent a thousand men selected from the troops
to escort the funeral and share the fathers
tears scant comfort for so great a grief yet
an homage due a parents sorrow Others quickly
wove a bier of pliant wicker from arbutus
and oaken sprigs On top they spread a canopy
of leaves They laid the young man out high on
his rustic litter He was like a flower
plucked by a girls hand a fragile violet
or drooping hyacinth whose bloom and beauty
70 had not started to fade though Mother Earth
no longer offered nourishment or strength
Aeneas fetched two garments stiff with gold and purple
Sidonian Dido had made these for him with
her own hands happy in her task working
the fabric with fine threads of gold He sadly
laid one over the young man a final honor
the one he put over the hair the pyre would burn
He heaped up many warprizes from the Laurentians
to be carried in the long procession and added
80 spears and horses taken from the enemy
330

Then he chose captives to be offerings to the dead
and bound their arms Theyd splash Pallas pyre with blood
Now he told his captains to hoist tree trunks
named for the dead foes armed with their weapons
Wretched Acoetes weak with age was led
along He beat his chest with fists and clawed his face
falling prostrate on the ground Next came chariots
spattered with Rutulian blood and Pallas warhorse
Athon without regalia weeping as
90 he walked his muzzle wet with giant tears
They brought his spear and helmet the victor Turnus
had the rest The grieving army followed Trojans
Etruscans and Arcadians their spears reversed
When this line of comrades had gone a good way
Aeneas stopped and said with a deep groan
The harsh fate of war calls me to other griefs
Farewell forever greatest Pallas forever
goodbye He said just this then turned
his steps back to the high walls of his camp
100 Meanwhile envoys turned up from the Latin city

wearing olive wreaths and asking for a favor
Could the bodies cut down on the battlefield
be returned for burial Surely there was
no quarrel with the lifeless victims Let him
show mercy to those he once called hosts and inlaws
Kind Aeneas granted them this favor
not one to be rejected but he added this
Latins what bad luck unjustly tangled you
in such conflict Why turn from your former friends
110 You plead for grace for men killed in the lottery
331

of war Id gladly give it to the living too
Ive only come because my fated home is here
Its not your people whom I fight its your king
who broke our ties and put his trust in Turnus army
It would have been more fair for Turnus to face death
If he plans to end the war by force and drive
the Trojans out then he and I should have crossed swords
The winner would have lived through his own skill
or a gods help Now go and stoke the pyre
120 under your fallen citizens Stunned to silence
they looked at one another with a searching gaze
Then the oldest Drances who detested Turnus
and kept hurling charges at the younger man
replied Trojan hero great in fame greater
in war how can I raise your praises to the sky
Should I first admire your justice or your prowess
Were glad to take these words back to our native walls
and if Fortune grants a way well ally you
with King Latinus Turnus can find his own treaties
130 Well even raise the great walls owed to you
by Fate and load our backs with Trojan rocks
He spoke they all roared assent as one
They fixed on twelve days truce Now Trojans mingled
with the Latins and safely roamed the forest ridges
in the shortlived peace Tall trees rang with axblows
Eagerly they uprooted soaring pines
cut down fragrant cedar split oak trees with wedges
and carried mountain rowans on their groaning carts
Now winged Rumor heartbreaks herald filled
332

140 Evanders ears home and cityRumor whod just

told of Pallas victories in Latium
Holding torches their custom for funerals
Arcadians streamed out to the gates The road
became a line of flame lighting up the fields
They fell in sadly with the crowd of Trojans
When the mothers saw this group arriving at
their homes they set the grieving town afire with cries
Nothing could restrain Evander He pushed
into the crowd As Pallas bier was lowered
150 he collapsed and clung to it groaning sobbing
At last his pain allowed a passage for his voice
Pallas this wasnt what you pledged your father
that youd be careful on the killing fields of war
I knew where pride in ones first arms could lead
and the sweet honor of victory in first combat
I mourn your tooyoung sacrifice the harsh lessons
of a war too close and my vows and prayers
heard by not one god My blessed wife
how fortunate you were to die before this grief
160 Ive outlived my very life Im my sons
survivor I wish Id joined the army of our Trojan
allies that Rutulian spears had rained on me
that this march brought my corpse home not Pallas
I dont blame you Trojans nor our pact nor
the hands we clasped as friends this was the fate assigned
to my old age But if an early death was destined
for my son Im glad he first killed thousands of the
Volscians and led Trojans to Latium
Pallas I could want no nobler funeral
170 for you than one held by pious Aeneas the great
333

Trojans Tuscan chiefs and all their troops
They bring great spoils from the victims of your sword
You too would be a huge trunk decked with armor
Turnus if Pallas were your age or had your strength
But my sorrow must not keep the Trojans
from the fight Go and tell this to your king
with Pallas gone I linger on in hateful life
only for your sword which owes Turnus to me
and to my son Only here is there room for
180 luck and glory I find lifes joys repellent
Ill take the news to Pallas in the Underworld
Now Dawn brought her kindly light to heartsick
humansand with it work and pain Father
Aeneas and Tarchon set up pyres along the curving
shore They fetched the corpses of their men
As was the custom sooty flames were lit below
the bodies the sky was veiled by grimy smoke
Three times the soldiers in their shining bronze
ran around the blazing fires three times the horsemen
190 circled the sad pyres calling out in grief
Their weapons and the earth were wet with tears
The shouts of men and blares of horns rose skyward
Some threw spoils from slaughtered Latins in the flames
helmets and fine swords bridles oncewarm wheels
of chariots Others added presents well known
to the dead their own shields and luckless spears
Many hulking bulls were sacrificed to Death
Over flames they slashed the throats of bristly boars
and sheep seized from the fields Holding vigil
200 over halfburnt mounds they watched their comrades blaze
334

along the shore They could not tear themselves away
till damp night ferried in the bright starstudded sky
Elsewhere but no differently the anguished Latins
raised up countless pyres Of their many dead
some they buried in the earth some they hauled
to nearby fields or sent on to the towns The rest
they set on firea massive heap of muddled corpses
without order without honor The ruined fields
and closeset biers blazed for both the armies
210 When the third dawn drove chill dark away
they raked and smoothed deep ash and nameless bones
mourning and heaped warm mounds of earth on top
The greatest clamor the greatest part of the long grieving
was in rich Latinus city and its homes
Here sad wives and mothers sons turned into orphans
and the loving hearts of weeping sisters
all damned the deadly war and Turnus marriage
he and only he should end this by the sword
he was the one who wanted to rule Italy
220 Fierce Drances fed the flames he swore that Turnus
had been challenged to a duel all alone
But many dissenting views were heard as well
in Turnus favor He was shielded by the power
of the queen and his fame from many triumphs

To crown this commotion as the heated quarrel
raged glum legates from Diomedes great town
returned with his answer All their efforts
335

had done nothing the gifts and gold their urgent
prayers had been useless They had to look for
230 allies elsewhere or ask the Trojan king for peace
This dreadful blow prostrated even King Latinus
The anger of the gods the many freshdug graves
showed him that Aeneas had been sent by gods
and Fate He summoned a high council of the local
chiefs to meet within his homes tall gates
They all gathered pouring to the palace through
the crowded streets As the oldest and most
powerful Latinus grimfaced took the center
He told the envoys whod arrived from Diomedes
240 to report their news everything in sequence
There was a call for silence Then obeying
the kings order Venulus began to speak
Citizens we reached Diomedes Argive
settlement overcoming all the dangers
of the road We clasped the hand by which Troy fell
Hed built Argyripa named for his fathers folk
after winning Ipyx fields near Garganus
When we entered and were granted leave to speak
we gave our gifts told him our names and country
250 named our attackers and the reason for our trip
to Arpi He heard and answered calmly
Happy race of Saturns realm Italians
of old what fortune rouses you from peace
and convinces you to rile up risky wars
All of us whose swords defiled the fields of Troy
forget what we endured in battle under those high
walls all the men Simos drowned paid dreadful
336

penance for our crimes lashed across the earth
Even Priam might have pitied us witness
260 Minervas cruel storm and the cliffs of vengeful
Caphereus Homeless Menelaus driven
from that war to other shores reached Proteus
Pillars Ulysses saw the Cyclopes of Etna
Think of Pyrrhus realm Idomeneus ruined
home Locrians left on the coast of Libya
or Agamemnon of Mycene who led the mighty
Greekshis vile wife struck him down at his own door
Her lover lurked in wait for Asias conqueror
The jealous gods denied me my ancestral altars
270 my longedfor wife and lovely Calydon
Still the ghastly sight of portents harries me
my vanished comrades seek the sky on wings
and flit among the streams as birds this was their
punishment They fill the cliffs with songs of sorrow
I should have expected this ever since
I madly struck a goddess body with my sword
defiling Venus hand with blood No
dont impose this conflict on me After the fall
of Pergamum Ive had no fight with Troy I take
280 no pleasure in recalling these old sufferings
The gifts you bring me from your homeland give them
to Aeneas I stood against his fierce sword
when we fought our duel Trust me I saw how high
he loomed above his shield how forcefully
he hurled his spear If Idas land had raised two more
like him the Trojans would have reached the Argive towns
with ease and defeated Greece would mourn her fate
While we waited round the sturdy walls of Troy
337

our victory was stalled by Hector and Aeneas
290 rebuffed for ten years Both men excelled
in bravery and skill in battle Aeneas
in piety If you can clasp hands and make
a pact Dont let your weapons clash in war
Best of kings youve heard the kings response
and the views he holds on this great conflict
Hed hardly finished when an anxious hubbub
of mixed voices rose up from the Latinslike
a rushing river slowed by boulders its trapped waters
churn and roar currents crash against the banks
300 Once they were calm and the anxious cries died down
the king invoked the gods and spoke from his high throne
Latins I wish wed made the better choice
to solve this crisis earlier and not to call
a council now with enemies camped by our walls
We were rash to battle with a race of divine
blood Theyre unconquered no fights tire them
Even in defeat they cant lay down the sword
If you hoped for Aetolian allies cease to
Anyone can hope but you see the odds
310 As for the rest of our affairs everything
lies smashed in ruins before your eyes and hands
I blame no one What the greatest bravery
could do we did We fought with all our kingdoms strength
Ill tell you the decision Ive now reached
after much reflection listen to my words
I own an ancient tract along the Tuscan river
It stretches west of the Sicanians
338

The Arauncans and Rutulians plow the flinty
hills and use the wildest parts for pasture
320 All this land with its pineclad mountain
ridge should be added to a Trojan pact
Lets fix fair terms and summon them to share our rule
If this is their desire they can settle here
and build their walls If they want other lands
and people and can safely leave our soil
lets build them twenty ships of native oak If they
have the men for more theres timber nearby
They can say how many ships they need
and of what sort Well give them workers bronze
330 and docks Also a hundred Latin nobles must go
to report my words and ratify the treaty
Extend olive branches offer gifts
and weights of gold and ivory my throne
and robe of state emblems of my rule
Lets consult on how to help our ruined land
Drances hostile still stood up Turnus glory
was a bitter goad to him a source of secret
envy He was free with wealth and eloquent
but froze in war a wise guide in councils
340 but good at rousing riots noble on his
mothers side but unknown on his fathers
With his words he stoked the common anger
Good king you ask advice on issues that are
clear without debate They all know how
our luck goes but they wont say it aloud
Turnus should stop his swaggering and let me speak
His ill favor with the gods his evil character
339

Ill say it let him threaten me with death
have caused many of our greatest men to die
350 have sunk our town in grief Meanwhile he provokes
the Trojan camp and waves his weapons at the sky
trusting in escape Best of kings add just
one thing to the many gifts and words you send
the Trojans dont let anyone use violence
to stop a father from the marriage of his daughter
to a great man in a fitting union
thus bringing peace But if such fear grips your minds
and hearts lets beg this favor from the man himself
Turnus grant our king and country their just rights
360 Why keep throwing our poor people in harms way
Youre the source of all our suffering
War wont save us We all ask for peace
and the single sacred bond that brings it
Ill be the first to beg though you claim I hate you
so be it have pity on your people set
your pride aside Youve lost so leave In our rout
weve seen enough of death and ruined land
If glory drives you and theres so much strength in you
if a palace as your dowry is so precious
370 dare your confidence against the enemy
So Turnus can win a royal wife should
our cheap lives be scattered through the battlefields
a crowd unburied and unwept You
if theres any spine in you any of
your fathers fight go face your challenger
Turnus temper blazed up at this speech
He groaned and burst out with deep feeling Drances
340

theres always floods of eloquence from you
when battle calls for action Youre the first to come
380 whenever councils called But the senate doesnt
need the boasts that fly from you while you are safe
while the enemys outside the walls and our
moats dont run with blood So thunder eloquently
as you do but dont charge me with fear until
your hand has heaped up piles of Trojan dead
and decked the fields with trophies Shall we see
what real courage can do We dont have far to go
to find the enemy they ring our walls
Come were off to battlewhy so slow
390 Will your fighting always be your flapping tongue
those feet so quick to flee You say Ive lost
Whod rightly say Id lost you filth You saw
the swollen Tiber surge with Trojan blood
Evanders house and family mowed down
the Arcadians stripped of armor Losing
is not how Bitias and huge Pandarus
saw it nor the thousand men I sent to Hades
in one day while trapped inside the Trojan walls
War wont save us Fool prophesy this wisdom
400 to Aeneas and yourself Go on alarm
us all with panic praise the power of a twicedefeated race deride Latinus forces
Youd claim the leaders of the Myrmidons tremble
at Trojan weaponsAchilles and Tydeus son
as well Indeed and the Aufidus flows backward
from the Adriatic The man says my threats
scare him clever ploy and backs his lies by quaking
Have no fear youll never lose your life
341

at my hands Keep it in your coward chest
410 King I return to our important plans
If you dont trust to weapons any more
if were on our own and completely ruined
after one repulse if Fortune cannot change
lets beg for peace holding out our wobbly hands
But oh if we had some of our usual courage
Id count the man who chose to die and bite the dust
instead of seeing such a day lucky beyond
others in the fight a paragon of courage
But if we have supplies and unharmed men
420 if Italian troops and towns are still our allies
if the Trojans glory cost them dear in blood
they too had their funerals the same storm battered
all of us why this shameful hesitation
at the start Why do we tremble at the bugle
The passing days the changes brought by shifting time
can improve much Sly Fortune comes in different shapes
She can set her victims back on solid ground
If Arpi wont help Messapus and good
Tolumnius will and the chiefs so many sent
430 No small glory will attend the chosen men
of Latium and the Laurentian fields
and Camilla of the noble Volscian race
with her mounted troops like blooms in bronze
If the Trojans challenge me to single combat
with your blessing if I impede our common good
Ill take my chances with so much at stake
Victory hardly hates or shuns my hands
Ill fight him bravelyno matter if hes stronger than
342

Achilles or wears Vulcans armor like him I pledge
440 my life to you and to father Latinus I
Turnus a lesser warrior than none before
Aeneas calls on me alone I hope he does
If the gods are angry it should not be Drances
who pays the price of death or wins glory and honor
While they clashed over these doubtful matters
Aeneas moved his camp and army And now
a messenger ran through the palace sowing
chaos filling all the town with terror His news
the Trojans and their Tuscan troops were marching
450 from the Tiber Their army swept the plains
At once the common folk were shaken and disturbed
Their rage grew at this stinging provocation
Eagerly the young men roared for weapons
sad fathers wept and murmured Everywhere
a clamor of dissent rose to the skies noisy
as a flock that comes to roost in a high forest
or raucous swans who honk along the fishrich
Padusa and its chattering marshes Turnus
grabbed his chance Thats right citizens call
460 a council sit here praising peace Meanwhile
theyre armed and invading He said no more
but leapt up and sprinted from the palace
commanding Volusus to arm the Volsican squadrons
and lead the Rutulians Messapus and Coras
arm the cavalry with Coras brother and spread
them out Some should back the gates others man
the towers The rest attack where and when I say

343

At once all the city scurried to the walls
But Latinus left the council dropping
470 his grand plans dismayed at this dark turn
blaming himself often for not welcoming
Aeneas to the city as his soninlaw
Meanwhile men dug trenches at the gates or hauled up
stones and stakes The harsh bugle blared wars bloody
signal Then a mingled crowd of wives and children
ringed the wall this last struggle called them all
The queen rode in her chariot to Pallas temple
and high citadel many mothers with her
bringing gifts Lavinia sat beside her
480 the cause of so much grief her lovely eyes cast down
The women entered and lit incense scenting all
the shrine pouring out sad pleas Virgin
Pallas great in war queen of battle
break the spears of the Phrygian bandit hurl him
prostrate on the ground before our city gates
Turnus armed himself impatiently raging
to fight He put the bright breastplate on
bristling with bronze mail His calves were cased in gold
his sword strapped to his side his head still bare
490 He gleamed with metal as he swept down from the
heights exultant In his mind hed already won
He was like a horse who rips his tether and
escapes the stalls Reaching open grassland
free at last he heads for pastures and for herds
of mares or flashes out for streams he used to bathe in
whinnying holding high his head
joyous as his mane plays on his back and neck

344

Camilla and her Volscian army rushed to meet him
At the gates the queen leapt down from her horse
500 All the cohort followed suit dismounting
in a fluid move She said Turnus
if the brave are right to trust themselves
Ill dare to charge Aeneas troops and ride alone
against the Tuscan cavalry this is my pledge
Let me scout out wars first dangers while you
take a post along the walls and guard the city
Turnus answered eyes fixed on the dangerous girl
O glory of Italy how can I thank you
or repay you For nowsince your courage
510 dwarfs rewardshare the struggle with me
Vile Aeneas rumor says and our scouts
confirm has sent his lightarmed horse ahead
Their hooves shake the plains as he heads for town
over mountain peaks and lonely ridges Ill set
an ambush at a byroad in the forest and
guard the pass at both ends with armed men
Youll confront the charging Tuscan cavalry
with fierce Messenus Latin squadrons and
Tiburtus troops Lead them and take charge
520 He urged Messapus and the allied chiefs to combat
too Then he left to meet the enemy
Theres a winding valley thats well suited
to treachery and tricks of war On both sides
dark slopes press it with dense growth A faint pathway
leads there from a narrow stinting pass
Above among the crags and near the peak
theres a hidden clearing and safe shelter
345

You can attack from either side or roll down
giant rocks while standing on the ridge
530 Turnus knew the way He came to take
his post lurking in the dangerous woods
Now in her high home Latonas daughter
summoned Opis swift of foot from her band
of sacred virgins She said sadly Dear girl
Camilla leaves for cruel combat with my armor
which wont help Shes loved by me beyond all
othersnot through some new passion this is
no sudden sweetness that has moved my heart
When Metabus hated for his haughty rule
540 left his land and ancient Privernum fleeing
from the heart of war he took his baby
with him He called her Camilla altering
her mothers name Casmilla by one letter
Clutching her to his chest he rode for long and
lonely forest crests But when sharp spears menaced
on all sides and Volscian soldiers circled him
as he fled he spied the river Amasenus
full and frothing at its bankssuch a storm
had broken from the clouds He could swim across
550 but fear for his cherished burden held him back
He thought it through and made a quick and painful choice
He took the giant spear hard with knots
and seasoned oak that his strong hand carried
into war wrapped his child in woodland corkbark
and tied this handy bundle to the spears center
He raised it in his massive fist and cried to heaven
Kind Diana of the woods a father vows his
346

child to you Shes your supplicant and holds
your weapon first as she flies from enemies
560 I beg you goddess take whats yours I yield her now
to the chance winds He drew back and threw
the spinning spear Poor Camilla flew across
the roaring river on the hissing shaft
Metabus the great crowd on his heels ever
closer plunged into the riverand emerged
The grassy bank gave back both spear and child
Dianas gift Since towns wouldnt let him in their
homes or walls he was too fierce to be civil
he fed his child among the brush and bristling lairs
570 A humble shepherd in the lonely mountains
he nursed her on a wild mares fresh milk
hed squeeze the udders drops onto her baby lips
And when she first walked on her infant feet
he armed her hands with a sharp lance and hung
a bow and arrows from her tiny shoulder
Instead of gold clasps and long capes to wear
a tigers pelt draped from her head over her back
Already then she scattered childsized spears from tender
hands and whirled a smooth sling round her head
580 bringing down a crane or snowy swan
Many mothers in the Tuscan towns were keen
to wed her to their sons in vain She was happy
with Diana and nursed an endless love of weapons
and virginity untouched I wish this war
had not encouraged her to challenge Trojans
Shes precious to me shed remain one of our band
But since harsh fate is at her heels glide down
from the sky and visit Latium nymph
347

where grim battle rages under gloomy omens
590 Take this quiver draw an arrow to avenge her
whoever wounds her sacred flesh Trojan
or Italian must pay an equal price
in blood Ill carry her poor body and unlooted
armor in a hollow cloud for burial
in her own land Jangling veiled in a dark whirlwind
Opis slipped down through the gentle breezes
Meanwhile the Trojan army Tuscan chiefs
and all the cavalry marshaled in ranks
approached the walls The horses reared and whinnied
600 through the fields fighting their tight reins wheeling
this way and that Everywhere the land bristled
with spears fields aflame with sunlit weapons
Messapus and the fastmoving Latins faced them
on the plain also Coras with his brother
and Camillas wing Spears jutted skyward
in hands pulled back to throw and lances quivered
The march of men and screams of horses grew hot
Each side stopped short within a spears throw
then suddenly burst forward screaming spurring
610 frothing horses Weapons rained down on all sides
as thick as snow shadowing the sky to darkness
Tyrrhenus and fiery Aconteus smashed
headon wielding lances They were the first to fall
colliding loudly as their horses crashed together
breastbone against breastbone Aconteus
flew off like a thunderbolt or stone hurled from
a catapult His lifebreath scattered to the breezes

348

Now the lines broke up The Latins wheeled
their horses to the walls and slung their shields across
620 their backs Acilas chased them with the Trojan troops
But near the gates the Latins raised the shout again
and pulled around their horses supple necks
Now it was the Trojans who retreated with slack
reins They were like the oceans ebb and flow
Sometimes it sweeps to shore and coats the rocks
with froth its arc soaking the far sand
sometimes it quickly ebbs sucking back
the rolling scree as the shallows boil
Twice Tuscans pushed Rutulians to the walls
630 twice they were repelled and had to guard their backs
with shields But in the third clash all the ranks were
tangled each man marked his target Then truly
you could hear the dying moans in that bloody
mess of bodies weapons halfdead horses
twitching in mens blood The savage fighting surged
Orsilochus fearing to face Remulus
flung his spear at his horse It went in
by the ear and the stallion reared pawing
at the air in agony his rider thrown
640 writhed on the ground Catillus killed Illas
and Herminius a huge man with huge courage
and huge weapons his blond head and torso bare
not afraid of wounds his giant frame exposed
A spear pierced his broad shoulders and stuck there
quivering It folded him in pain Pools
of gore were everywhere Fighting they dealt
death with iron seeking wounds to die with glory

349

There in the carnage raged Camilla with her quiver
one breast bared for battle like an Amazon
650 She hurled a rain of pliant lances or raised
her heavy battleax in her tireless hand
Dianas gold bow jangled on her shoulder
Even when she had to yield she shot arrows
while escaping her bow turned to face the fight
Around her was her chosen band young Larina
Tulla and Tarpeia swinging her bronze ax
all daughters of Italy Divine Camilla
chose them as her honorguard to help in peace
or warlike Amazons riding across the river
660 Thermodon or fighting by Hippolyte
in painted armor or shrilling loudly when Mars child
Penthesilea came back in her chariot
and her crescentshielded women troops rejoiced
Fierce girl who were the first and last to fall
under your spear How many dying bodies did you
spread on earth First Eunaeus son of Clytius
Her pine lance pierced his unguarded chest
and he fell retching streams of blood Dying
he bit the bloody earth coiling round his wound
670 Next Liris and Pagasus one thrown from
his fallen horse and reaching for the reins
one rushing to help no weapon in his hand
She dropped both there and added Amastrus
Hippotas son Rising in her seat she speared
Tereus Demophon Harpalycus
and Chromis Every shaft whirled from her hand
found its Trojan Far off the hunter Ornytus
350

was riding an Ipygian horse in foreign armor
A hide stripped from a bull sat on the fighters
680 massive shoulders and a whitefanged wolfjaw
gaped over his head in those rustic hands
he held a hunting knife He rode in the middle
of the ranks but stood a full head higher
Overtaking him it was easy in the rout
she pierced him through and said with hate Tuscan
did you think that you were flushing forest beasts
The day has come that shows your boasts were lies
and at a womans hands But youll take great glory
to your fathers shades Camillas spear killed you
690 Next were Butes and Orsilochus largest

of the Trojans She speared Butes from behind
between the helmet and the breastplate where his neck
gleamed white on the left the shieldside
Orsilochus chased her in a giant circle
but she tricked him into tighter ones hunting
the hunted then reared up and smashed her heavy ax
into his bones and armor as he begged for mercy
frantically Warm brains from the blows streamed down
his face Aunus fighting son an Apennine
700 chanced on her and froze in fear at the sight
He was a good Ligurian liar while fate allowed
When he saw he couldnt use his horse
to get away and dodge the queens attack
he tried a shrewd pretense and said with cunning
Whats so great about a woman counting on
her brawny horse Forget escape Be brave enough
to meet me face to face on even ground fight me
351

on foot Youll soon know whose boasts of bravery
are meaningless Enraged and hot with fury
710 she handed her horse to a friend facing him
on foot and unafraid Their weapons were the same
a bare sword and a light shield The soldier
thought his trick had worked Off he raced at once
pulling round the bridle to escape
using iron spurs to goad his horse Stupid
Ligurian she cried puffed up with pride in vain
You tried your slippery native skills for nothing
Your ploy wont bring you back unharmed to lying
Aunus On swift feet just like a darting flame
she overtook his horse grabbed its reins
720 and spilled his hated blood in vengeance
easily the way a sacred falcon soars from
some tall crag to chase a dove high in the clouds
and catches her tearing out her guts with curling
claws From the sky fall blood and tattered feathers
The father of the gods and men throned on high
Olympus did not fail to see this He spurred
Tuscan Tarchon into rage and bitter battle
with no gentle goad Tarchon galloped out
to the slaughter and retreating ranks
730 urging on the cavalry with varied shouts
naming them reviving beaten troops for war
Whats your fear Tuscansalways slow to fight
but never shamed by it Whats this great cowardice
A woman scatters you and routs your ranks
We carry swords and spearsfor what Youre not
slack for loves nocturnal combat or when
352

the curved flute calls for Bacchic dances Yes
wait for feasts and wine and groaning tables
heres passion and dedication till the seer
740 says alls safe till meaty sacrifices call you
to the groves With that he whipped his horse
into the fray prepared for death charging wildly
at Venulus He tore him violently off his
horse and rode off with his enemy clutched to
his chest Shouts rose to the sky all the Latins
turned to watch Tarchon flew like fire over
the plain with his armed prey He snapped Venulus spear
at its metal tip groping for an open spot
to stab a deathblow Venulus fought back
750 keeping that hand from his throat surviving force
by force Like a tawny eagle whos snatched up
a snake and soared away twining talons in
the wounded reptile the snake forms slick coils
raising its rough scales and hissing trying
to rear up but as the eagle beats the air
with wings its hooked beak mauls its thrashing victim
just so Tarchon took his prize from Tiburs ranks
triumphant The Tuscans followed on their chiefs
example and successthey charged Then Arruns
760 doomed by Fate circled swift Camilla with his
spear a crafty fellow searching for an easy
chance While the girl rode raging in the ranks
Arruns stole up close and followed silently
when she returned from killing enemies
he yanked his quick reins furtively and trailed her
Ruthless he tried this approach and that traced
her path on every side and shook his wellaimed spear
353

By chance Chloreus once Cybeles priest
was gleaming from afar in Phrygian armor
770 He rode a foaming mount whose leather saddlecloth
was plumed with bronze scales and golden links
Standing out in his exotic reds and purples
he shot Cretan arrows from a golden Lycian
bow It hung from the seers shoulders
His helmet was gold too a golden knot tied up
the rustling linen folds of saffron cloak
His tunic and his Asian leggings were embroidered
The huntress stalked this one man blindly in the strife
of war She hoped to hang his Trojan weapons
780 in a temple or flaunt herself in captive gold
a girl on fire with a females lust for spoils
riding recklessly through all the ranks
At last Arruns saw his chance from where he lurked
He threw his spear praying to the gods above
Greatest of the gods you who guard sacred
Soracte we worship you first Apollo When pinetrees
feed your flames we your followers
trust our faith and plant our steps on your live coals
Almighty Father let my sword obliterate
790 this source of shame I dont want spoils or trophies
nothing that is hers My other feats will bring
me fame Just let me kill this pestilence
and Ill return unhonored to my native town

Apollo heard and granted one part of the plea
354

The rest he scattered to swift breezes Yes
Arruns could kill the girl in her distraction
with a sudden blow but hed never see his
noble land again The south wind took those words
He threw his spear it whistled through the breeze
800 All the Volscians turned their sharp eyes mindful
to their queen But she failed to note the rush
of air the weapon flying through the sky
until the spear found its mark Wedged below
her naked breast it drank deeply of her blood
Her stricken band rushed up to catch their falling queen
Arruns the most terrified of all fled
in mingled fear and joy He didnt dare to trust
his spear further or face Camillas weapons
He was like a wolf whos killed a shepherd
810 or a giant bull and runs to hide in trackless
heights before the vengeful spears can find him
He knows he went too far and tucks his trembling tail
below his belly heading for the woods
Anxiously he hid himself from sight
content to get away and mingle with the ranks
Camilla dying tugged the spear but its iron
tip was wedged too deeply in her ribs
Her blood draining she collapsed her eyes fell
chill with death Her bright complexion faded
820 As she died she called to her friend Acca
Shed been loyal beyond others to Camilla
the only one to share her cares Ive fought
this far sister Acca Now a bitter wound
has finished me The world grows dark with shadow
Run and take these last commands to Turnus
355

he must take up the fight and keep the Trojans
from the town And now goodbye She released
her horses reins and weakly slipped to earth cold
departing from her body bit by bit Her head
830 and neck drooped down in death her weapons fell Her soul
fled with a groan of protest to the shades below
Now a huge cry rose and struck the golden stars
With Camilla down the fight was crueler still
The Trojan army Tuscan chiefs and Evanders
cavalry rushed at each other in dense ranks
Dianas sentry Opis had been resting on
a high ridge for some time calmly gazing at
the fight As the raging men sent up a roar
she saw from far away Camillas killing
840 She groaned and said these heartfelt words Oh no
my child youve paid too cruelly for your attempt
to wound the men of Troy in war Your service
to Diana your solitude in the wild woods
shouldering her quiver was no help to you
Yet the queen wont let you be dishonored
in your final hour Your death wont want for fame
among the nations nor will you suffer shame
dying unavenged He whose wound defiled you
will die as he deserves Below that peak there lay
850 a giant burialmound its soil shaded by oaks
for the ancient king Dercennus Laurens
Swooping down the lovely goddess landed
here first and looked for Arruns down below
There he was gleaming in his armor puffed up
with vain pride Leaving us she asked Turn
356

this way come and die Receive a fitting prize
for Camillas death Dianas shafts will kill
even the likes of you The goddess took a speedy
arrow from her golden quiver and drew her bow
860 hating him pulling evenly until
the curved tips almost met Her left hand touched
the iron tip her right the bowstring by her breast
Arruns heard the hissing arrow and the rush
of air just as the iron point lodged in his flesh
His friends forgetful left him there gasping out
his life groaning in the fields ignoble dust
But Opis soared on wings to high Olympus
Their leader gone Camillas lightarmed wing fled first
In shambles the Rutulians and fierce Atinas
870 ran as well The scattered chiefs and headless legions
looked to safety horses wheeled in retreat
None could hold against the Trojan onslaught
bringing death none could take a stand
Their unstrung bows on crouching backs they shook
the pockmarked plain with horses at full gallop
A murky cloud of black dust rolled toward the city
Mothers beat their breasts along the lookouts
and raised their womens shrieks to the high stars
The first to burst in at a gallop through the gates
880 brought the enemy mixed in with them and met
a wretched death right at the walls They died impaled
on swords on their own soil next to the very safety
of their homes A group closed the gates
scared to admit allies or yield to their pleas
Then came a wretched slaughter of the Latins those
357

guarding the gates and those impaled on the guards swords
Before the faces of their weeping parents
some were thrown into the trenches by the
desperate stampede some let go their reins
890 and wildly rammed the gates and bolted doors
On the walls trembling mothers strained to rain down
weapons on the Trojans mimicking Camilla
spurred by love of country They used oaken posts
and firecharred stakes in place of iron they burned
to be the first to perish for their citys sake
The ghastly news hit Turnus in his forest
Acca told the young man of the massive rout
the Volscian ranks wiped out Camilla dead
the enemys assault how Trojans swept the field
900 with Mars support the panic at the walls In rage
as Jupiters cruel will demanded Turnus
quit his hilltop ambush and left the rugged forest
He was hardly out of sight heading for
the plains when Aeneas crossed the mountain ridge
to open fields and put dark woods behind him
Now both were riding fiercely for the town
with all their troops not much space between them
At the moment that Aeneas saw the plain
smoking with dust and the Laurentian army
910 Turnus saw savage Aeneas in armor and heard
the infantrys approach and panting horses
Both would have tried their luck in war at once
but rosy Sun had washed his tired team in Spanish
waters bringing night as day glided away
They camped before the town and built their ramparts
358

BOOK 12


As soon as Turnus saw the tide had changed
and the defeated Latins looked to him to pay
his pledge he blazed with new and ruthless courage
Like a lion on the plains of Africa
who strikes at last after the poachers spear
has pierced his chestfearless full of joy
he tosses his thick mane breaks the shaft wedged
in the wound and roars from bloodstained jaws
just so Turnus burning fury reached its peak
10 Wildly he addressed the king Theres no delay
in Turnus no reason for Aeneas coward band
to eat their words or break their pledge Ill fight
Bring the offerings father set the terms
Either Ill dispatch this Trojan traitor down to
Tartarus let the Latins sit and watch refuting
by my sword the charge against us all or else
well be his slaves and Lavinia his wife
Latinus answered calmly Peerless fighter
your fierce courage outstrips other mens
20 So much the more I must reflect with care
on all the outcomes that I fear You rule
your father Daunus land plus many towns taken
359

by force You have my gold my goodwill too
Laurentian lands and Latium have other
girls of noble birth Let me speak these harsh words
honestly take them to heart I had no right
to give Lavinia to any former suitor
All the gods and men prophesied this
Conquered by my love for you our common blood
30 my wifes sad tears I broke all bonds stole his
right bride from my sontobe and waged an unjust
war You can see the battles and bad luck
that dog me since youve borne the brunt of them
Beaten in two fights we can barely nurse
Italys hopes at home Our spilled blood warms
the Tibers waters our broad fields gleam white with bones
Why go back and forth To change my mind is madness
If Im prepared to accept allies once youre dead
why not end this conflict while you live How would
40 your Rutulian kin and all of Italy
respond if I gave you up to death may god
forbid as you fought to win my child
Think of wars uncertainty Pity your old
father forlorn and far away in Ardea
These words had no effect on Turnus fury
It flared up still more savage for being soothed
As soon as he could speak these words burst out
That care you have for mekindly discard it
best of kings and let me trade my life for glory
50 Father I too fling spears with force the wounds
that I inflict draw blood as well His mother
wont be lurking near in swirls of empty mist
to cover his retreat in an unmanly cloud
360

But the queen aghast at this new combats risk
ready to die wept and clasped her fierce
soninlaw Turnus by these tears by my
honor if it touches you at allyoure my
only hope my sole relief in grim old age
Latinus glory and his power our whole reeling
60 house all rests on you I ask just this dont fight
the Trojan Your fate in that duels mine as well
Ill leave this hated light of day with you
Ill never be enslaved and see Aeneas as
my soninlaw Lavinia heard her mothers words
Tears ran down her burning cheeks a deep blush
warmed her skin and spread its fire through her face
just like Indian ivory stained by crimson blood
or snowy lilies tinted red by a rose
bouquet Such colors stood out on the young girls face
70 His love churned in Turnus He stared at her hotter
still to fight and spoke curtly to Amata
I beg you not to send me off with tears and evil
omens mother when I leave for battles brutal
combat Turnus cannot choose his hour of death
Idmon take my message to the Trojan king
It wont please him When Dawns rosy chariot
reddens the sky he should not lead out his men
let Trojan and Rutulian weapons rest
Well stop this string of battles with our blood
80 On that field Lavinia will be won as wife
He spoke and hurried to his home calling for
his horses happy as they neighed before him
361

Orithyia gave them to Pilumnus as an honor
a team whiter than snow swifter than the wind
The chariotdrivers stood around thumping the horses
chests combing their flowing manes Turnus seized
a breastplate stiff with gold and orichalcus
He strapped on his sword and shield and placed
the crimsoncrested helmet on his head
90 The god of fire had forged the sword for Turnus father
Daunus and tempered the bright blade in Stygian waters
Then he raised the sturdy spear that leaned against
a giant central column spoils from Actor
the Auruncan and shook its undulating length
Nows the time my spear now Ive never called
in vain Great Actor carried you now Turnus
right hand carries you let me strike dead
that Phrygian halfman let me strip and smash
his armor Ill foul with dirt those waves of hair
100 dripping with scented oil and crimped with a hot iron
Such a rage drove Turnus As he raved sparks flew
from his face his eyes flashed fire He was like
a bull that bellows terribly as combat starts
trying out its anger on a tree trunk
with its tusks goring all the winds with wounds
pawing sand as prelude for the battle
Just as fierce in his mothers armor Aeneas
roused himself to fight and stoked his rage
He was glad this mutual pact would end the war
110 Then he soothed his friends and fearful Ilus
with talk of fate and ordered that a firm response
be sent to King Latinus with the terms for peace
362

As fresh dawn flecked the mountain peaks with light
and the horses of the Sun soared over Oceans
edge streaming light out of their flaring nostrils
Rutulians and Trojans checked the dueling ground
next to the walls of the great city They put out
firepans and grassy altars for their common
gods Priests in aprons wearing sacred vervain
120 on their brows fetched the fire and water
The Ausonians marched up with their lances spilling
out the crowded gates From the other side
the TuscanTrojan army rushed up with diverse armor
and so much iron youd think Mars own cruel strife
had mustered them In the center captains
milled around proud in gold and purple
Mnestheus from the blood of Assaracus brave
Asilas and Neptunes son Messapus
the horsetamer At the sign each side pulled back
130 staking spears in the soil propping up
their shields Women unarmed crowds and weak old men
came in an eager flood to fill the roofs
and towers others stood by the high gates
Juno gazed down from a hilltop now called Alban
in those days it had no name no glory and no
honor looking at the plain and armies
Trojan and Laurentian and Latinus city
At once as one goddess to another she spoke
to Turnus sister queen of lakes and roaring rivers
140 Jupiter the high skyking had honored her
this wayafter stealing her virginity
Nymph beauty of the rivers dearest to me
363

you know Ive loved you more than any other Latin
girl whos suffered greatsouled Joves unwelcome lust
I freely let you have a share of sky
Learn the griefnot caused by methat waits for you
While the Fates and Fortune seemed to favor
Latium I shielded Turnus and your city
Now I see him heading to an unfair death
150 The day of death and devastation comes
I cannot watch this combat they agreed on
If you dare to help your brother do it you should
Maybe better times will come for us who suffer
Shed barely finished but Juturnas tears were falling
she beat her lovely breast three or four times
This is not the time for tears Saturns daughter
told her Hurry If theres any way rescue him
from death Stir up war and wreck the treaty
they drew up Ill take responsibility
160 She left her wavering a harsh wound in her heart
The kings rode out Latinus in his massive fourhorse
chariot twelve golden rays around his gleaming
browthe emblem of his ancestor the Sun
A snowwhite pair pulled Turnus In his hand
he brandished two broadheaded iron spears
From the facing camp marched out Father Aeneas
founder of the Roman race his starbright shield
and godsent armor blazing and Ascanius
Romes other great hope A priest in pure robes
170 fetched a bristly boars young and an unshorn sheep
and stood the beasts next to the flaming altars
The men now faced the rising sun sprinkled salt meal
364

from their hands and cut tufts off the victims brows
Then they poured libations on the altars
Pious Aeneas drew his sword and prayed
I call on you as witness Sun and this land
for which Ive borne such suffering and you
almighty Father and you Juno his wife
a kinder goddess now I hope and you famed
180 father Mars whose will inflicts all wars on us
I call on springs and flowing rivers all the powers
in high heaven and the bluegreen sea if chance
grants triumph to Italian Turnus the losers
will retire to Evanders town Ilus
will leave this land and Aeneas men will never
rise in war as rebels or bare their blades against
this realm If however victory favors us
as I believe and may the gods confirm it
I wont make Italians bend to Trojans
190 or seize power Let both peoples strike
a timeless treaty equal laws for two free nations
Ill give you gods and rites Latinus father to
my wife will keep his throne and army Trojan
hands will build a town named for Lavinia
Next Latinus spoke He looked up at the sky
his right hand lifted to the stars Aeneas
I swear by the selfsame land same sea and stars
by Latonas double brood and twofaced Janus
by the Hellgods power the shrines of ruthless Dis
200 Hear me Father you who bind pacts by your thunder
I grasp your altar and I swear amid these flames
365

and holy forces Italy will never break
this pact of peace whatever comes to pass
No force will bend my will not even if
it pours the flooded Earth into the sea and Heaven
into Helljust as this scepter in his hand
hacked off in the forest orphaned from its mother
its leaves and twigs lost to the knife will never
pour out tender shoots or shade though it was
210 a branch until the craftsman wrapped it in wrought bronze
and gave it to the Latin lords to carry
With such words they sealed the pact as all the nobles
watched Then they slaughtered sacrificial
animals over the flames ripping out live
entrails and piled the altars with the heavy plates
But the Rutulians had long since thought the duel
unfair They felt a tumult of emotions
still more when they saw the unmatched fighters close
still more when they saw Turnus step silently
220 up to the altar eyes downcast as he prayed
his face so young his youthful body pale
When Juturna saw more people muttering
the crowd wavering and losing heart
she rushed among the soldiers taking on Camertus
formhis ancestors were a great clan
his fathers name was linked with valor he himself
was fiercest in the fightknowing well
what she must do and planting different rumors
For shame Rutulians Youd risk one life for all
230 of us Arent we matched in strength and numbers
See what the Trojans and Arcadians amount to
366

plus the doomed Etrurians who dare to take on
Turnus Our enemys too few for half of us
Turnus goes in glory to the gods whose altars
hell exalt in death Hell live on the lips
of men But we our country lost will have to
serve proud masters we who idle on these fields
More and more her words inflamed the men
A murmur started snaking through the ranks
240 and the very Latins and Laurentians
whod hoped for peace and rest from battle
now once more wanted war and wished the pact
would fail They pitied Turnus sorry fate
Juturna added a still greater spur
She showed an omen in the sky perfect
to muddle and mislead Italian minds
Joves tawny eagle flying in the ruddy light
was bothering the shorebirds a large and noisy
flock Suddenly he plunged toward the water
250 his vicious talons seized the noblest swan
The Italians took note as all the birds
wheeled round in raucous flight an amazing
sight darkening the sky with wings chasing
the eagle through the air until done in
by pressure and his heavy prey he dropped the swan
into the stream and vanished in the clouds

The Rutulians hailed the omen with great shouts
and prepared to arm Tolumnius the augur
367

was the first to speak Ive prayed for this so often
260 I accept the divine sign Take up your swords
and follow me poor countrymen whom that foreign
pirate preys on like an eagle as he sacks
your shores He too will soon fly off sailing for
deep ocean One resolve for all Close up
your ranks and fight to save your deposed king
He hurled his spear and charged the enemy
The wellaimed cornel shaft sang out whistling as it
cut the air At once a mighty roar rose up
Chaos in the ranks as all hearts boiled in tumult
270 It happened that nine handsome brothers stood right
in the spears path the sons faithful Tyrrhena
had borne Gylippus of Arcadia It struck
one at the waist where the leather swordbelt
chafed his stomach and the ends were pinned
This beautiful young man so bright in his armor
the weapon split his ribs and splayed him on the sand
His brothers a brave phalanx fired by grief
drew their swords or grabbed their iron spears
and blindly rushed ahead The Laurentians charged
280 then in response rushed in a flood of Trojans
Agyllines Arcadians in painted armor
All felt the same desire to let the sword decide
The altars were stripped of kindling A thick storm
of spears filled the sky a pelting iron rain
Winebowls and firepans were raided Latinus
fled with his failed gods and broken pact
Men harnessed chariots or vaulted onto horses
swords bared ready to fight Messapus keen to
368

end the treaty drove his horse at terrified
290 Aulestes an Etruscan king decked in a kings
regalia As he quickly backed away
the poor man tripped over an altar falling on
his head and back Fierce Messapus flew in
on his great horse his spear in hand as the king
babbled in prayer he struck him dead and said
Hes done Heres a better offering to the gods
Italians ran to loot the stillwarm corpse but
Corynaeus stormed them with a smoking altarbranch Then Ebysus charged in to stab him
300 The flaming branch thrust in his face set fire to
his beard which gave off a scorched smell Corynaeus
grabbed his frantic victims hair in his left hand
kneed him to pin him down and sank his vicious
blade into his side Next Podalirius
chased the shepherd Alsus as he fled among
the front lines swords But as he raised his naked blade
Alsus heaved his ax at him and split his head
down to his chin Spurting blood soaked all his armor
Iron sleep and cruel silence pressed upon
310 his eyes their brightness buried in eternal night
Pious Aeneas head bared for the ritual
stretched out unarmed hands and shouted to his men
Whats this attack How can battle start again
Control yourselves The treaty has been struck all
the terms are set The right to fight is mine alone
Let me do it dont feel fear Ill confirm
the pact by my own hand Our rites owe me Turnus
But as he spoke these words a hissing arrow
369

sliced the air toward him No one knows
320 whose bowstring whirled it home who brought
the Rutulians this honor a god or chance
The great glory of the act was stifled
no one boasted of Aeneas wound
When Turnus saw Aeneas yield saw his captains
at a loss he burned with sudden eager hope
Calling for his armor and his team he proudly
leapt into his chariot and took the reins
He raced along the ranks sending many brave men
down to death crushing others halfalive
330 under his wheels grabbing spears to throw at those
who ran He resembled bloodsoaked Mars
in action when he clangs his shield by icy Hebrus
to start a war and drives his frothing horses through
the empty plain faster than the winds from west
and south Thrace groans under pounding hooves
By Mars ride pitchblack Terror Rage and Treachery
With such fervor Turnus lashed his steaming
sweaty team in the center of the skirmish trampling
the defenseless dead The racing hooves sprayed
340 crimson dew throwing up the bloodsoaked sand
He killed Sthenelus then Thamyrus and Pholus
the last two handtohand the first speared through He killed
Glaucus and his brother Lades Imbrasus sons
raised by him in Lycia They had the same weapons
fit for combat or to race the winds on horseback
In another part Eumedes rode to battle
old Dolons son renowned in war His name was
from his grandfather but his strength and courage
370

were his fatherswho once dared to claim Achilles
350 chariot as a prize for scouting the Greek camp
but Diomedes paid him in a different coin
he no longer hopes to win Achilles team
Turnus saw him far away across the open
plain and transfixed him with a flying lance
He flew up and leapt down from his chariot
tall over the Trojan dying on the ground
then planted his foot on his neck and wrenched away
the mans own sword He dyed the bright blade ruddy in
Eumedes throat See the fields of Italy
360 you fought to winlie there now and measure them
Such are the prized city walls for those who cross me
He speared Asbytes to keep Eumedes company
and Chloreus Thersilochus Sybaris
Dares Thymoetes just thrown from his horse
As the Thracian north wind howls over
the deep Aegean chasing waves to shore
gusts buffet the sea clouds scuttle from the sky
so the ranks fell back where Turnus cut a path
and columns turned and fled His momentum
370 carried him his crest shook in the airstream
Phegeus would have none of this attack
these roars Flinging himself at the chariot
he pulled aside the bolting horses foaming bridles
As he hung there dragged alongside Turnus stabbed
his bare flank with a broadtipped lance that pierced
the twoply chain mail The lance stuck in the shallow wound
Phegeus turned to block him with his shield
pulling out his sword in selfdefense but
the wheel and spinning axle threw him to the ground
371

380 With his sword Turnus struck his head off

between the helmet and the breastplates upper edge
and left the headless body on the sand
While Turnus dealt relentless death across the plain
Mnestheus staunch Achates and Ascanius
brought Aeneas into camp He was bleeding leaning
on his lengthy spear with every other step
and furious He struggled to rip out
the broken arrow shouting for the easiest
solution to cut the wound wide open with a sword
390 and find the buried arrowhead then go back
to battle Now Ipyx Isus son arrived Apollos
favorite Once in passions painful grip
the god had offered Ipyx his own skills and talent
augury the lyre and flying archery
But to stall his ailing fathers death Ipyx
chose to learn the use of herbs and medicine
to practice silent arts that brought no glory
Aeneas leaned on his huge spear grumbling
bitterly A throng of soldiers crowded round him
400 as Ilus grieved He ignored their tears Old
Ipyx hitched his cloak and tunic as healers do
Quickly he applied Apollos potent herbs
and potions Nothing worked not tugging at the arrow
with his hand not clamping on the iron head
with a forceps grip Fortune and the god
offered no help and meanwhile battles horror crept
across the plain so close they could see a wall
of dust As the cavalry approached arrows
rained into the camp The awful screams of men
372

410 who fought and fell in the hard combat rose to sky

Then Venus distressed at her childs undeserved pain
plucked sprigs of dittany from Cretan Ida
a plant of purple blooms and downy leaves
not unknown to wild goats struck in the side
by flying arrows She fetched it her face shrouded
in thick mist and made a secret potion steeping
the stems in a gleaming bowl of water
adding an elixir of healing ambrosia
and fragrant panacea Aged Ipyx soothed
420 the wound using this brew without knowing
At once all pain left Aeneas body
and the bleeding in the wound was stanched
Now the arrow came out freely when he pulled
New strength restored Aeneas to his former state
The first to fire their hearts against the enemy
Ipyx shouted Hurry bring the man his weapons
Dont just stand there Aeneas no human art
or doctors skill cured you nor did my hand
A great god did He sends you to greater work
430 Eager to fight angry at lost time Aeneas
sheathed his calves right and left in golden
greaves and took up spear sword and breastplate
He clasped Ascanius with chainmailed arms
kissed him lightly through the visor and said
Son learn bravery and real work from me
from others luck My right hand is your
defense it will lead you to great prizes
Make sure to be mindful when you are a man
of the models that your family left I
373

440 and your mothers brother Hector should inspire you

With these words he left the gate a great figure
wielding a great spear Mnestheus and
Antheus and a dense throng marched with him
The reserves all left the camp as well
The plain trembled under tramping feet as blinding
dust rose up From the rampart Turnus saw them
as they came The Ausonians saw too
and felt an icy shiver Juturna heard and knew
the sound before the Latins did She fled
450 afraid as Aeneas raced across the open
field with his dark troops Like a storm breaking
at sea whose thunderheads approach the shore
as howling winds precede them foreboding fills
the wretched farmers hearts for the storm will blast
their trees and crops destroying everything
just so the Trojan leader drove his men against
the enemy their columns closepacked round him
Thymbraeus killed great Osiris with his sword
Mnestheus killed Arcetius Achates killed
460 Epulo Gyas killed Ufens Tolumnius
the augur fell the first to throw his spear
Shouts rose to the sky and the Rutulians
routed in turn ran across the dusty fields
Aeneas didnt stoop to killing fugitives
nor those he met on foot nor horsemen holding lances
Through clouds of dust he tracked only one man
his challenge was for one alone Turnus
At this Juturna numb with fear became
374

a warrior She heaved Metiscus Turnus driver
470 from the reins and he fell hitting the beam
Leaving him behind she took his post his voice
his form and armor pulling on the reins to swerve
like a dusky swallow flying round the halls
of some rich lord circling the high rooms in flight
gathering tidbits for her cheeping fledglings
as she flutters through the empty porticoes
or by the wet rain gutters so Juturna
veered through the enemies and all the plain
in her rapid chariot Now here now there
480 she granted glimpses of proud Turnus but steered him
far away avoiding conflict Aeneas tracked
her twisting course chasing Turnus calling for him
loudly through the scattered ranks But every time
he spotted him and ran toward the racing horses
Juturna turned the chariot aside
What could he do He was carried on a sea
of thoughts none useful his cares pulled at him
Messapus approached stealthy on his feet
two spears in his hand each tipped with iron
490 He threw one with unerring force Aeneas stopped
and crouched behind his shield dropping to one knee
But the flying spear still sliced off his helmets
crested peak Then he saw Turnus chariot
eluding him again and fresh anger at
Italian treachery rose up in him Calling
Jove to witness and the altars of the broken
treaty he plunged into the heart of battle
with Mars on his side Now he killed at random
terrifying as he let his rage run free
375

500 What god can help me sing of so much horror

the great slaughter and slain generals the men
whom Turnus then the Trojan hero drove over
the plain Jupiter did you want nations fated
for eternal peace to clash so violently
Rutulian Sucro didnt keep Aeneas long
He stabbed Sucro in the side the first fight
to slow the Trojan rush and pushed the hard blade
through the ribs that hold the heart an instant death
Turnus unhorsed Amycus and his brother
510 Diores He hit one with his lengthy lance
as he approached then the other with his sword
and hung both severed heads dripping blood from
his chariot Aeneas sent Tanas Talos
and brave Cethegus to death three at once
and sad Onites Peridias Theban son
Turnus killed the brothers from Apollos Lycian
fields then Menoetes of Arcadia
whose aversion to war was no use Hed fished
Lernas fertile streams his pauper home unknown
520 to patrons his father farmed on rented fields
Like fires set in arid woods from facing sides
racing through the crackling laurels like foaming rivers
roaring as they crash down mighty mountains
in their rushing course blasting open
their own channels as they run into the sea
so Turnus and Aeneas tore through the lines
Rage boiled in them both Without restraint hearts
bursting they used all their strength for slaughter
376

As Murranus bragged of ancestors and ancient
530 names all his race back to the Latin kings
Aeneas whirled a giant rock and smashed him
to the ground under the yoke and reins The wheels
rolled him forward and his horses careless of
their master trampled him with thudding hooves
Hyllus charged with a huge roar Turnus threw
a spear at that goldclad head The weapon pierced
his helmet and lodged in his brain Cretheus
strongest of the Greeks your strength didnt ward off
Turnus Cupencus your gods didnt save you
540 from Aeneas As the spear hit your chest
your bronze shield offered one poor second of delay
Aeolus Laurentian fields saw you die too
You sprawled across the soil on your back
you whom Argive phalanxes had failed to kill
and Achilles though he toppled Priams kingdom
Here was deaths finish line Your noble home
was near Ida in Lyrnesus but your grave
was in Laurentian earth Now all the lines wheeled round
the Latins Trojans fierce Serestus and Mnestheus
550 Messapus the horsetamer and brave Asilas
the Tuscan legion and Evanders Arcadians
It was each man for himself with all he had
There was no pause no rest in the ravages of war
And now his lovely mother put a notion
in Aeneas head that he should hurl his army
at the city walls and stun the Latins
with this new calamity Tracking Turnus
he gazed around and saw the town untouched
377

by the huge war immune The thought of greater
560 stakes enflamed him He called to him the chiefs
Mnestheus brave Serestus and Sergestus
and stepped up on a mound The Trojan legions
ringed it not setting down their shields or spears
From the center he cried Jupiter stands with us
Let my orders meet with no delay even
if this strategy is new No holding back
Today Ill storm the town thats caused the war Latinus
capital and raze its smoking rooftops to
the ground unless they surrender and submit
570 Should I wait till Turnus deigns to fight
with mea man Ive beaten once before
Citizens this is the source and sum of unjust war
Bring torches quickly Well reclaim the treaty
with our flames All of them with eager effort
made a wedge formation the dense mass stormed
the walls Ladders torches suddenly appeared
Some ran to kill the sentries at the gates
others showered spears The sky was dark with weapons
Aeneas himself in the front and by the walls
580 raised his right hand and denounced Latinus loudly
swearing by the gods that he was forced to war
again Italians again had broken faith
turned foe Discord broke out in the trembling town
Some wanted to fling the gates wide open to
the Trojans and drag the king up to the walls
some rushed to guard the ramparts with their weapons
just like bees when a shepherd tracks them
to a porous rock and fills it with harsh smoke
disturbed they scurry round their waxy camp
378

590 sharpening their outrage with loud buzzes

As the black stench fills their home the rock
resounds with humming smoke coils in the clear sky

Now a new misfortune struck the weary Latins
one that shook the city to its core with grief
When the queen at home saw the enemy
approach saw the walls attacked torches flying
at the roofs no Rutulians defending
none of Turnus troops the unhappy woman
thought hed died in combat Pierced by sudden grief
600 she cried she was the cause and culmination
of their pain Speaking wildly in despair
and set on death she tore her purple robe
and hung a noose around a beaman ugly end
When the wretched Latin women heard this news
first Lavinia tore her golden hair and gouged
her rosy cheeks then the group around her
insane with grief The palace echoed their lament
From here the tragic rumor spread across the city
All hearts sank Latinus tore his clothing
610 stunned by his wifes death and his towns ruin
fouling his white hair with filthy dirt
Meanwhile fierce Turnus at the edge of battle
still followed some stragglers but more slowly
His horses skill now pleased him less and less
On the wind came shouts of unseen horror
He listened to the ominous low rumbles
379

sounds of a city in distress and cried
620 What great grief disturbs our walls Whats this
uproar coming to us all the way from town
With these words he seized the reins frantic to stop
But his sister posing as the charioteer
Metiscus still steering team and chariot
countered This way Turnus Lets pursue
the Trojansweve found victory on this path
There are others to defend the walls by force
Aeneas is attacking the Italians
we can inflict brutal deaths on Trojans
630 You wont leave the battle his inferior
in honor or men killed Turnus answered
Sister I knew you long ago when you ruined
the treaty with your wiles and joined the fight
You dont deceive me goddess But who wanted you
to leave Olympus and endure these efforts
Was it to see your luckless brothers brutal death
What should I do How can Fortune save me
Murranus died before my eyes calling out
my name a great fighter he fell to a great
640 wound No one I love equally still lives
Unlucky Ufens perished so he wouldnt see
my shame the Trojans have his armor and his corpse
Should I let our homes be razed all thats left
and not silence Drances insults by the sword
Should I turn tail and let this land see Turnus
run away Is death so dreadful Smile on me
shades of the dead since the gods are hostile My soul
descends to you unmarred by cowardice Ive never
been unworthy of my noble ancestors
380

650 And now Saces galloped through the fighting

his horse foaming himself wounded by an arrow
to the face He begged Turnus as he passed
Youre our last hope Turnus Pity your people
Aeneas thunders in his armor threatening
to raze our citadel and ruin us all
Already burning torches land upon our roofs
We look to you King Latinus is still muttering
about whom to call his soninlaw which pact
to pick As for the queen who loved you most
660 shes killed herself in fear and left the light of day
Messapus and brave Atinas stand alone
before the gates and hold the line Legions press them
all around a dense and spiky crop of swords
Still you drive in circles on the empty grass
The image of these losses staggered Turnus
Silent he stood and stared His heart seethed with
mixed emotions shame and grief mingled with madness
love driven by fury and selfconscious courage
When he shook the shadows from his mind
670 and could see clearly he turned his burning eyes toward
the walls and city from his chariot aghast
A spiral flame was rolling up a towers stories
billowing to sky eating the whole structure
a tower he himself had built with jointed beams
set on wheels and fitted with high walkways
Sister fate has won Stop delaying me
Lets go where Jove and heartless Fortune call
Im resolved to fight Aeneas and ready
381

for death even if its bitterno more disgrace
680 Just let me rage this final bout of rage
Leaping from his chariot he bolted through
the hostile swords deserting his sad sister
and burst into the center of the fighting
Just as a rock uprooted by the wind will tumble
down a mountainside after violent rain
or passing years have weakened its grip
flying down the sheer slope the ruthless boulder
bounds over the ground bowling over trees
and herds and men so Turnus flung apart the ranks
690 racing to the city walls There the earth
was soaked with blood spears whistled through the air
He raised his arm to signal shouting loudly
Rutulians now stop Latins hold your weapons
The plans of Fate are meant for me Its right
that I pay for the broken pact alone my sword
will decide All pulled back and left a space
But when Father Aeneas heard Turnus name
he left the walls and towers breaking off from
all wars worknot a moment of delay
700 Exultant he clanged his weapons grimly
looming like Mount Athos or Mount Eryx
or father Apennine as he soars skyward joyous
when gusts rustle oak trees on his snowy peak
Now they all turned eagerly to watch
Rutulians Trojans and Italians men on
the high ramparts men with batteringrams below
They all put down their shields Even Latinus
was stunned to see great men from distant points on earth
382

meet and clash with swords a contest to end war
710 When a level space was clear on the field
they hurled their spears and ran toward each other
Bronze shield hit bronze shield and the fight began
The earth groaned as the two men rained down swordstrokes
blow on blow chance and courage in the mix
like two bulls butting heads in mortal combat
on huge Sila or Taburnus heights
the cowhands retreat in fear and the herd
waits silently The heifers wonder who will
rule the forest who will lead the herds
720 the bulls trade wounds with brutal violence
locking horns goring flesh splashing blood
across their shoulders as the woods echo their grunts
just so Trojan Aeneas and the Daunian hero
clashed with shields A huge din filled the air
Jupiter himself balanced a scale
and put the two lives in the pans to see
whose acts were doomed whose weight plunged down to death

Turnus sprang forward seeing a safe chance
He surged to his full height raised his sword
730 and struck The Trojans and the Latins cried out
anxiously on edge But the faithless blade
snapped off and failed him His only recourse was
to run Seeing the strange hilt in his defenseless
hand he fled faster than the eastern wind
They say that when he climbed into the chariot
for battle in his haste he left his fathers sword
383

and grabbed Metiscuss instead It served
him all the while he chased the straggling Trojans
But when it came to Vulcans divine weapons
740 the mortal blade shattered like brittle glass
its fragments glinting on the yellow sand
Desperate Turnus looked for any way to get
away tracing confused circles in the field
But the mass of Trojans shut him in all round
and here a huge marsh stopped him there high walls
Aeneas too though troubled by his knees
the wound slowed them down it was hard to run
pressed his frantic enemy step for step
like a hunting dog whose barks threaten
750 a stag trapped by a stream or feathered cordon
fearful of the bank and snares the stag wheels round
a thousand times but the nimble Umbrian
hound pursues him closely mouth agape
he thinks he has him any moment now
and bites but his jaws snap shut on empty air
Now shouts rose up in earnest The banks and lakes
echoed the sound the whole sky thundered with
the din As he ran Turnus chided all
his men by name demanding his own sword
760 while Aeneas vowed instant death to anyone
who helped and terrified the trembling enemy
with threats to raze the city He pressed on though wounded
They raced five full circuits and five in reverse
this way and that since they sought no small or paltry
prize but vied for Turnus life and blood

384

An olive tree with bitter leaves once grew there
holy to Faunus and revered in the old days
by sailors saved from seawrecks On it they nailed
gifts to the Laurentian god and hung their votive
770 clothing But the Trojans had chopped down the tree
without a thought so they could fight on open ground
Here stood Aeneas spear wedged into
the stubborn roots by the force with which it flew
The Trojan bent to wrench it free hed use
the spear to strike the prey he couldnt catch
on foot Then Turnus cried out wild with fear
Faunus please have pity And you kind Earth
hold fast that spear if I ever kept your rites
which Aeneas men have profaned in their war
780 He didnt pray for the gods help in vain
Aeneas though he struggled long and hard
over the stubborn stump could not pry apart
its wooden grip despite his strength While he strained
Juturna again appearing as the driver
Metiscus dashed up to give Turnus his sword
Venus outraged at the nymphs audacity
came and pulled Aeneas spear from the roots
Spirits soaring both men rearmed one trusting
to his sword one tall and fierce with his spear
790 They faced each other panting in the toil of war
Now the king of great Olympus said to Juno
as she watched the battle from a golden cloud
Wife what will be the end of this Whats left
You yourself admit Aeneas will reach
the stars and rise to heaven as the nations god
385

Whats your plan what hope keeps you in chill clouds
A mortal man wounded a god was that right
Or that Turnus got his sword I know you helped
Juturna and the losers have new strength
800 Stop at last and be persuaded by my prayers
Dont let silent grief consume you dont make me
hear again your sweet mouth utter sad concerns
Its over You harassed the Trojans across
land and sea you ignited awful wars
you ruined a home and mingled grief and marriage
I forbid you to do more So he spoke
Juno answered with bowed head I knew
your will great Jupiter thats why I left
the earth and Turnus I didnt want to Otherwise
810 you wouldnt see me sitting in a cloud alone
enduring everything Id be in the front lines
ringed with flames Id drag the Trojans into battle
Its true I told Juturna she could help
her distressed brother and dare more for his life
but not to use her bow and arrow I swear it
by the river Styxs unforgiving source
the only oath revered by the upper gods
Now Ill yield and leave this loathsome war
But I beg one thing not forbidden by fates
820 laws for Latium and the glory of your
Latin kin when theres peace and wedding
celebrations when they join in laws and pacts
dont command the Latins on their native soil
to change their name to Teucrians becoming
Trojans or to change their clothes and speech
Let Latium and Alban kings last through the ages
386

Let Romes children triumph with Italian courage
Troy perished let her name perish as well
The maker of all men and matter smiled and said
830 Truly youre Joves sister and a child of Saturn
such waves of anger surge inside your heart
Come now give up this rage you honed for nothing
I grant your wish and willingly Youve won
The Ausonians will keep their fathers speech
customs and name The Trojans will subside into
mixed stock Ill add Trojan rites to local ones
theyll all be Latins with one language
Youll see a race arise from their mixed blood
that will surpass both gods and men in piety
840 No other race will pay you so much honor
Agreeing to these terms Juno turned her mind
to happiness She quit her cloud and left the sky
This done the Father pondered a new problem
how to drive Juturna from her brothers side
Men say there are twin plagues called Furies daughters of
the dead of Night born with hellish Megaera
Night wrapped them all in serpent coils and added
windswift wings They serve before Joves throne
on the threshold of the savage king and whet
850 the terror of weak humankind any time
the king of gods devises vile death and disease
or terrifies a guilty town with war
He told one to hurry from the sky
and cross Juturnas path an evil omen
A rapid whirlwind carried her to earth
like an arrow springing from a bow Parthian
387

or Cydonian that races through the clouds
carrying venom a wound beyond curing
crossing the swift shadows hissing and unseen
860 So rushed the child of Night heading for earth
When she saw the Trojan lines and Turnus troops
she quickly took the shape of a small owl
that sits on tombs and lonely rooftops late at night
and hoots her eerie notes among the shadows
The monster fluttered around Turnus face
screeching her wings beating at his shield
A strange numbness left him weak with dread
His hair stood up in horror his voice choked in his throat
Turnus unhappy sister knew the Furys shrilling
870 wings from far She tore her hair and gouged her face
with fingernails pounded on her chest with fists
Turnus how can your sister help you now
Should I give up heartlessly But what skill
of mine could stall your death I cant fight a Fury
Ill go Ill leave the battle Vile bird dont scare me
Im afraid already I know the deadly drumming
of your wings Great Joves proud commands
are clear Is this my virginitys reward
Why give me immortality Why cant I die
880 as humans do Then I could end this crushing grief
and follow my sad brother to the shades
Immortal life is worthless What will bring me pleasure
without you What earth can gape open so deeply
as to send a goddess to the shades below
She said this groaning deeply then draped her head
in graygreen robes and plunged deep in the river

Aeneas was in pursuit He shook his massive spear
almost a tree and spoke these savage words
Whats the delay now Turnus why retreat
890 This contest is a duel not a race
Go on change yourself to any shape gather
all your strength and skill such as you have chase
the stars on wings hide yourself in Earths deep
hollows Turnus shook his head Fierce Aeneas
your hot words dont scare me its the gods I fear
and Joves enmity He looked around and saw
a giant rock an ancient giant rock set in the plain
a boundary mark for conflicts over land
Hardly twelve men could lift it on their shoulders
900 such men as Earth produces now But the hero
grabbed it in his hands and rose then ran
toward his enemy and heaved the rock at him
But even as he ran even as he raised and
threw the giant boulder he didnt feel like Turnus
to himself his knees couldnt hold him fear chilled
his blood His rock tumbling through the empty air
didnt bridge the gap didnt reach its goal
It was like a dream when drowsy sleep lies on
our eyes we feel were trying to run but somehow
910 its no use we collapse weakly as we try
The strength we know is gone we cannot speak
no words or sounds come out Just so the awful goddess
kept Turnus from success despite his bravery
Then mixed emotions churned inside his heart
He hung back in dread and gazed at the Rutulians
and the city trembling at his coming death
There was no place to run no strength to fight

no chariot to see no charioteer no sister
As Turnus faltered Aeneas saw his chance
920 Raising his fatal spear he put all his body
in the throw No stone hurled from a siege engine
ever roared so loudly no clap of thunder ever
crashed like this The spear flew a black tornado
bringing dreadful death Hissing it tore through
the breastplates border and the outer circle of
the sevenlayered shield and ran right through his thigh
His legs folded and huge Turnus crumpled
to the ground The Rutulians leapt up groaning
The hills and forests echoed their cry far and wide
930 Humbly Turnus raised his eyes his hands
and begged I deserve this I dont ask for mercy
use your chance But if a parents grief can touch you
have pity for old Daunus you had such a father
in Anchises and return me to my people
as a corpse if you prefer Youve won
the Ausonians have seen me stretch my hands out
in defeat Lavinias yours Dont press your hatred
further Fierce Aeneas stood there armed his eyes
roaming restlessly holding back the deathblow
940 And now more and more Turnus words began
to move him and he hesitatedwhen high on Turnus
shoulder he saw the fatal swordbelt of young Pallas
the strap flashing with its wellknown studsPallas
whom Turnus killed when down and took that emblem
of the enemy to wear upon his shoulder
Aeneas drank in this reminder of his savage
grief Ablaze with rage awful in anger he cried
390

Should I let you slip away wearing what you
tore from one I loved Pallas sacrifices
you Pallas punishes your profane bloodand
950 seething planted his sword in that hostile heart
Turnus knees buckled with chill His soul fled
with a groan of protest to the shades below
